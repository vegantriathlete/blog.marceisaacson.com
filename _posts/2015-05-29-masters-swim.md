  be good for me to do my own easier workout anyway. But, then I remembered that it
  was the last Friday of the month and decided it wouldn't be a problem if I got to
  the pool a little late and modified the assigned workout.</p>"

<p>I took a couple of days off since I was feeling exhausted and was also feeling a cold coming on. I was a little bit slow getting ready to leave the house and thought about just waiting until later to do the workout, figuring that it might be good for me to do my own easier workout anyway. But, then I remembered that it was the last Friday of the month and decided it wouldn't be a problem if I got to the pool a little late and modified the assigned workout.</p><p>As it turns out I ended up swimming with a couple of other people in the lane and I did have to pick up in the workout at the point where they were. It all worked out fine, though. I don't know how many meters I did in total. But, it was an enjoyable workout and, as usual, I was really glad that I did do it first thing in the morning.</p><p>One interesting thing that I noticed during the workout was that it seems like I'm actually a somewhat better / faster swimmer than my lane mates, but I fade really quickly. So, while I start out the repetition having to back off some, by the end I'm having to work to keep up. This experience shows me that I still am weak and need to put on more muscle. It also gives me some encouragement that I will see me pace improve over time as I do get stronger.</p>
