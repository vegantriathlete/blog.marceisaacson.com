<p>How the week went overall: It was good.</p><p>One thing that did not go according to plan: I didn't complete as much screen capture as I had hoped.</p><p>One thing that went well: I mustered the energy and focus to at least get some screen capture.</p><p>Plans for the coming week: Get whatever screen capture completed that I can in the mornings and evenings. I think that maybe I will see about getting the final videos done for section one of "Mastering Drupal 8 Development." I don't know if I want to get into the voice over or not.</p>
