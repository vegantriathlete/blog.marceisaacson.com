<p>Today's scheduled workout was a 2500 swim workout.</p><p>I was a little slow getting ready this morning and debated about whether I should skip the Masters swim and do my own workout later; I knew that I wasn't goint to make it to the Masters workout on time. I decided that it would still be better to show up late and headed out the door. I did miss the first set (200 crawl). But, I'm glad that I did decide to show up for the workout. It's great to complete the workout first thing in the morning, it's nice to have the variety that the coach put into designing the workout and it's nice to have lane mates to swim with. At the end of the workout one of my lane mates commented that I was considerably faster than when I first started. What a nice reward for having shown up!</p><p>I swam something like 1850 meters.</p>
