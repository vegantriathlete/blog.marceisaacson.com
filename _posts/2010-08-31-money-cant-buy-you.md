<p>a job?</p>
<p>I renewed my teacher's license so that I could substitute teach. Last week I attended the orientation session and filled out my paperwork. Since I was non-renewed at my first teaching job (due to lack of a good fit) I needed to provide a favorable performance review from another job. Well, I had disposed of all that paperwork a couple of years ago. So, I went back to my last teaching job and got copies of the observations from that year and dropped them off at the administration building. On Friday I received an email that those informal observations were not sufficient; I need an official annual performance review. Now I am in the process of getting a copy of my performance review from my second teaching job; I hope that it will be ready for me to pick up by the end of the week.</p>
<p>I am really frustrated with how much work I am having to put into being considered for a job that is supposed to be a backup plan. This is certainly the opposite end of the spectrum from when I was such a hot property that I was getting calls from recruiters all the time offering to set up interviews for jobs that were moving me to the next rung on my career path.</p>
<p>This is such a strange experience. I know that I'm still the same person, offering the same talent, potential, intelligence, and tenacity that I offered back when I was so highly sought after.</p>
<p>Thank you, Universe, for this lesson in humility. I surrender and I am open and ready to receive.</p>
