<p>Tonight Eli and I were picking up dinner from Chipotle. I had a gift card in my wallet and I used it to pay for the bill. As it turns out, I ended up with a remaining balance of $0.26. Unsurprisingly, I didn't have any cash in my wallet and I was going to have to pay with a credit card. The person in line in front of me was returning to the counter to pick up his order and he noticed the situation. Without hesitating, he opened his wallet and handed one dollar to the cashier and walked away. He didn't even wait to get his change.</p>

<p>There are kind and generous people in the world.</p>

<p>I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and am open and ready to receive.</p>

<p>Bhavatu sabba mangalam - May all beings be happy</p>
