excerpt: "<p>I ran for about 75 minutes. It was pretty sunny and hot. This was a hard
  workout even though I'm still keeping a slow pace. I know that the swim workout
  on Friday was hard and so was yesterday's bike workout. So, I'm sure that I was
  still tired from those efforts. I'll be following the same workout schedule again
  next week. This coming week is the week that Carmody is closed for maintenance;
  it was not last week. I'll need to do my swim workouts at Green Mountain, which
  is a 25m pool.</p>"
