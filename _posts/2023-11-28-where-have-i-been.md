excerpt: Sometimes I get distracted by shiny things
title: Where have I been
---
Well, I didn't really expect that I was taking a step back for over 3 years!
At this point I can't recall why I stepped away for so long.

This post is going to be really quick.
I am still alive and I am still trading.

If I thought that my losses on HTZ or LUV were big, boy was I going to be surprised just how much more I would eventually lose!
I never did share the outcome of my BYND LEAPS.
Long story short: I have lost almost all the money.
Wouldacouldashoulda: I could have traded it at many points for a very nice profit, but I held on to it too long in a foolish / greedy attempt to hold on to all of the premium.

I have made even worse trades than the BYND trade.
I won't go into all of the details.
I have a very large unrealized loss right now, but will be slowly realizing those losses over the next few months or so.
Once I realize those losses, they will eat up all of the profit I have made and will then give back even more.
I plan to share in a future post (after the new year and tax filing) my net gains and net losses for each year I have been trading.

Trading is much harder than I thought it would be.
I still have a LOT to learn.
I haven't given up, yet.
But, the jury is still out whether I will continue to do this for the long run.

I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me.
I surrender and am open and ready to receive.

Bhavatu sabba mangalam - May all beings be happy
