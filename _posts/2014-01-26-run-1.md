<p>I ran for thirty minutes around Kendrick Lake. I averaged around 9:30 miles.</p><p>My Achilles is still tight and sore. It loosened up pretty well during the run, but never to the point that it didn't bother me at all.</p><p>I think that I need to cut out the run workouts for one week. I'm frustrated, because the Chi Running technique is supposed to enable you to run injury free. I don't know if I've got this injury because I switched my technique or because I did too much too soon. It's probably a combination of the two with a somewhat heavy influence from using the new technique. Maybe I exaggerated something and threw myself out of alignment. Sigh.</p>
