excerpt: "<p>I did another walk/run/walk workout today. Since I needed to make a deposit
  in our checking account, I turned it into my workout. Mapping it out, it looks like
  I walked for about .9 miles, ran for 1.1 miles, ran for 1.6 miles and finished up
  by walking .4 miles for a total workout of about 4 miles.</p><p>The weather was
  gorgeous: sunny, in the mid- to upper-70's.&nbsp;</p>"
