<p>I rode the Cybex upright bike for one hour and fifteen minutes using the heart rate program at 138bpm. The bike allows only up to 60 minutes. So, I actually rode for about 58 minutes and thirty seconds. Then I reset the program for another 17 minutes.</p><p>This was a big jump in time from my longest ride to this point and the workout was very hard. I am totally spent. I don't know what my average speed for the workout was since I had to do it in two separate pieces. I didn't pay attention to what my mileage was on the first or second pieces. But, I'm pretty sure that my average pace was below 17mph.</p>
