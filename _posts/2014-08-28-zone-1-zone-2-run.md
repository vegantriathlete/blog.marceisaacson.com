excerpt: <p>Today was supposed to be another Sprint Tri Workout. But, I had worked
  all day long and I didn't feel like going to the gym to do the workout. I decided
  to get the dog out for a walk first, and then that turned into my workout. I walked
  the dog at a brisk pace for about an hour. So, I guess you could consider this a
  Zone 1 "Run."</p><p>If I count yesterday and today's workout, this was my twenty
  first workout in my IM journey. I guess it seems like a good time to stop the count
  in my posts. I'm not sure if I should count today's workout and now the numbers
  start to become compound.</p>
