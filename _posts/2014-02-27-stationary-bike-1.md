  45 minutes and a total of 12.52 miles, which is equivalent to about 16.7mph. This
  is a little slower pace than my last 45 minute workout. I'll keep an eye out to
  see if my average pace continues to drop. For, the moment it's probably safe to
  just assume that my body is just a little tired now.</p>"
