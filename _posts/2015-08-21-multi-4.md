  a number of reps where I was supposed to swim 25m without breathing. That's way
  beyond my ability at this point. I gave my best effort for the workout.</p><p>I
  ran for about 1:00. But, I think I'll need to pay more attention to how I feel from
  the double hill workout on Thursday. I'm pretty tired right now and I do want to
  make sure that my bike workouts take priority. I'll have to see what I can do tomorrow
  and Sunday.</p>"
