<p>I didn't work out on Saturday or Sunday. I have also decided that I am going to take this whole week off and pick things up again next Tuesday.</p><p>I've still got some congestion in my nose and a bit of a sore throat. It will be better for me to be fully recuperated. Fortunately, I've started this journey with plenty of time to spare; this little pause in the action won't have any negative long-term impact.</p><p>The timing of this delay also works out well on account of the fact that Lana is going to be attending a workshop this week. My parents are here to help with taking care of Eli. But, it will still be much easier to not have to worry that I'll be out doing a workout early in the morning and Eli happens to wake up while I'm gone. I'm sure my parents will appreciate knowing that they won't potentially be called into action before it's even light outside. (I do plan to talk to the Masters swim coaches this week. So, they are not totally off the hook).</p><p>In the meantime, I am going to practice my new routine of getting up at 5AM (and getting to bed by about 9PM).</p><p>I got up this morning and headed out the door to talk to whoever is the Monday morning Masters swim coach. But, then I realized that Mondays are always my off days and it didn't make sense for me to talk to that coach. I will definitely want to talk to the Tuesday and Friday coach. I'll have to think about if it makes sense to talk to the Wednesday and Thursday coach. I don't even know how many coaches they have and what days each one coaches; I'll find that out tomorrow.</p>
