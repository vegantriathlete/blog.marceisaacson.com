excerpt: "<p>I waited until later in the day to do my workout again. I swam 5 minutes,
  biked about 22 minutes and ran 15 minutes. I rode on the Expresso bike again today
  and did the City Express course. Yesterday's course was out of the Basic options
  and today's was out of the Moderate. Well, yesterday I had to extend the distance
  to take up the full twenty minutes. Today riding for 22 minutes I still couldn't
  cover the whole course. This course had a lot of climbing on it. There were may
  sections in which the grade exceeded 30%."

<p>I waited until later in the day to do my workout again. I swam 5 minutes, biked about 22 minutes and ran 15 minutes. I rode on the Expresso bike again today and did the City Express course. Yesterday's course was out of the Basic options and today's was out of the Moderate. Well, yesterday I had to extend the distance to take up the full twenty minutes. Today riding for 22 minutes I still couldn't cover the whole course. This course had a lot of climbing on it. There were may sections in which the grade exceeded 30%. I had a lot of fun riding the course, but I think I need to be careful not to push myself too hard too soon. Even though the bike is not showing my HR getting too high, my perceived level of exertion is definitely about as high as I think I should be right now.</p>
