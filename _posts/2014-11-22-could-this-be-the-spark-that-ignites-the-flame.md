excerpt: <p>I was up at 4:30 this morning. When I signed in to my business email to
  check the status of things, I saw that the <a href="http://blog.isaacsonwebdevelopment.com/blog/2014/11/20/new-approach-drupal-training">blog
  entry</a> I had posted on Thursday (and which hit Planet Drupal that same day) had
  gotten a new comment. As it turns out there is a <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/open-drupal-training">Drupal
  group</a> that is working on the very same type of idea as my <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vegantriathlete/teach-yourself-drupal">Kickstarter</a>.

<p>I was up at 4:30 this morning.

I was so excited to get connected with @hedley_smith. I think that this connection gives me a good path forward regardless of whether the campaign gets funded. I also think that it gives me a great channel to help me get the campaign funded as well as a great network of potential collaborators when the campaign does get funded.</p><p>Yippee!</p><p>I've been busy for about five hours now working on the campaign. I'm going to get Zen out for a walk and then do my ride.</p><p>I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and am open and ready to receive.</p><p>Bhavatu sabba mangalam - May all beings be happy</p>
