<p>In the previous blog entry I wrote about how challenging attending the retreat proved to be and how I wanted to leave every other day. I didn't give much of an idea of what the schedule looked like each day. So, here it is:</p><p>4:30am - 6:30am: Meditation</p><p>6:30am - 8:00am: Breakfast and personal time</p><p>8:00am - 9:00am: Meditation</p><p>9:00am - 11:00am: Instruction and meditation</p><p>11:00am - 1:00pm: Lunch and personal time</p><p>1:00pm - 2:00pm: Meditation</p><p>2:00pm - 5:30pm: Instruction and meditation</p><p>5:30pm - 7:00pm: Light snack and personal time</p><p>7:00pm - 8:00pm: Meditation</p><p>8:00pm - 9:30pm: Discourse and meditation</p><p>The 8am, 1pm, and 7pm meditations were group meditations in which we were required to be in the meditation hall. Additionally, once we started the "Sittings of strong determination" these were the three times we were expected to do them.</p>
