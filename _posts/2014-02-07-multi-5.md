<p>I ran for 15 minutes, which was the full scheduled amount for this workout. There was an exercise class in the gym that was playing loud music. So, it was hard for me to keep the proper cadence. But, if anything, I think I may have been running faster.</p><p>I did another pyramid workout. 200 yards warmup @ 1.30 seconds per stroke; 25, 50, 75, 100, 75, 50, 25, 50, 75, 100, 75, 50 yards @ 1.20 seconds per stroke; 25, 25 yards @ 1.15 seconds per stroke; 200 yards cool down @ 1.30 seconds per stroke.</p><p>The graph is showing the calculated seconds per 50 yards.</p><p><img src="/sites/blog.marceisaacson.com/files/uploads/tempo-trainer-20140207.png" alt="seconds per 50 yards chart" width="547" height="307" /></p><p>It is nice to see that I hit that first 25 at an equivalent of 50.6 seconds per 50 and the first 50 at 52.4 seconds. It's also nice to see that those last two 25's done at 1.15 seconds per stroke increased my speed. I don't know how I slowed down so much on the cool down.</p><p>It looks like right now I have to figure that I'd average around 1:56 per 100 (58 seconds per 50) for a long distance. I suppose it might be worth doing a workout of 1200 yards at 1.30 seconds per stroke just to see the actual results. If I'm really at 1:56 per 100, then I'm already right on the target I have set for 2014.</p><p>My strokes per length climbed as high as 22.</p>
