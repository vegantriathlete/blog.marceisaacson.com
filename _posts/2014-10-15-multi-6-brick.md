<p>My legs felt tired as I headed out for this ride. I had to turn around at the earliest point I have ever turned around on this route. So, I was certain that the bike computer would show that this was the slowest I have ever ridden this route. On the way back home I was thinking about the fact that last week was the fastest I had ever ridden this route. When I got home my average speed was definitely NOT the slowest I have ever ridden this route. It wasn't as fast as last week, but it was faster than most weeks. I don't know how to explain how I ended up not being slower than all the other rides when I turned around the earliest. Maybe I rode faster on the way home and maybe the other times I ended up riding for more than thirty minutes. Today I rode almost exactly thirty minutes.</p><p>I ran for about fifteen minutes and as it turns out I beleive this was the most distance I've covered on this route. But, it's also possible that I was running at a higher heart rate.</p><p>All in all, I think it definitely bears giving myself a bit of time at this week's program to let myself adjust.</p><p>The weather is amazingly beautiful today. I think it was in the upper seventies while I did my workout.</p>
