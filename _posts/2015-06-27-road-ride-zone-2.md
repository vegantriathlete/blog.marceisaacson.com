<p>I had to break my workout into two parts today.</p><p>I rode an extended route to a birthday party and spent about 1:40. I took Jewell / Alameda / Rooney / Golden Trail / Johnson / Ford / Iowa / Washington / Golden Trail / Golden Gate Canyon and then looped back to the party. There was a stretch on Ford that was the steepest inclimb I have ever ridden. Fortunately it was reasonably short or I might have had to get off my bike.</p><p>From the party I made my way back down the Golden Trail to Lookout Mountain. I took it all the way to 40 and then came back on 40. I took Rooney into Alameda and then headed down along C470 to Colorado 8 back home.</p><p>I averaged only 12.6 mph. So, that's a bit concerning. There's not too much I can do about it though. I'm doing the best I can.</p><p>I'm pretty tired right now. It was hot and sunny and my route was pretty hilly.</p>
