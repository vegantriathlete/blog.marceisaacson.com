We kicked as hard as we could for 50 and then swam 100.</p><p>I finished up with a 100m cool down.</p><p>Today I was really swimming over my lane mates and Jim suggested that I try the next lane over next time. While there is no doubt that they are swimming faster than I am, I think that I may be just close enough to their pace that I'll be able to hang on at the back of the group. We'll see how it goes next week!</p><p>I ran 54 laps in 30:15. That equates to about an 8:40 pace.</p>
