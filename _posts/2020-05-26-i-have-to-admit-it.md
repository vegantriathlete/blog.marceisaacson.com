excerpt: I've made some really bad trades recently
title: I have to admit that I feel embarrassed and ashamed
---
Yesterday was Memorial Day and the markets were closed.
I decided that I was going to wait to see what happened today to write my trading journal.
I'm going to keep this short today, because I'm tired and feeling really defeated.

HTZ declared bankruptcy and it's likely to be delisted from NYSE.
Trading was halted on the stock today and I'm left holding 1800 shares @ 3.00.

LUV closed the day at $32.52.
So, I'm feeling really burned by having sold the call at $27.50 and getting assigned last week.
I gave back essentially all the premiums I had collected.
Now I'm afraid to sell PUTS at $30 again because I think it could take a huge drop again.

I failed to sell 2 PUT contracts of HPE at a strike of $9 and a premium of $0.15.

I think I need to approach this with the perspective of letting go of my ego and having a true beginner's mind.
It's probably better that I got hit this hard early and for a relatively small amount of money.

I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me.
I surrender and am open and ready to receive.

Bhavatu sabba mangalam - May all beings be happy
