  strategy worked beautifully. I'll be perfectly happy to post an 8:30 clock time

I'll be perfectly happy to post an 8:30 clock time for the race.</p><p>Figuring a 90 minute swim, 8:30 clock time bike and 5:12 marathon, plus 18 minutes of transition time would bring me in at 15:30. I will be absolutely ecstatic if that ends up being my finish time!</p><p>That which very recently seemed so improbable now seems entirely likely. I think I'm going to be an official finisher in my first IronMan distance race!</p><p>I don't know how long I'll run tomorrow and I don't know exactly what I will do next week. For sure I want a big taper the week before the race. I'm excited to see how all this works out for me :)</p>
