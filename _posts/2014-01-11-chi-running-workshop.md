Nonetheless, I do have a few good focal points to practice.</p><p>Doing the knee lift drill was really helpful for me. Keeping that idea of lifting my feet like that and letting my wheel spin behind me helped to eliminate my small bit of dorsiflexing.</p><p>I'm going to have to do a lot of work to get the proper posture for my pelvis.
