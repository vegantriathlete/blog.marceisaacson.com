<p>I'm not generally affected by New Year's Eve and the start of a new year. However, last night I found myself feeling emotional as I shut down my computer at the end of the work day and as I headed out to do a workout. I couldn't put my finger on why I was holding back tears. Were they tears of joy or tears of sadness?</p>

<p>2018 was a very good year for me overall. Sure, it had its parts that were less-than-ideal. But, those parts were the exception, not the rule. So, I don't know if I was happy to reflect on how well the year went or if I was sad to see it go? Was I feeling an overwhelming sense of gratitude or a fear of whether 2019 would be as good?</p>

<p>I still don't know how to explain the emotion(s) I was feeling late yesterday afternoon. And I'm not going to go into a deep analysis now. Instead, I'll accept the mystery of life and welcome 2019 with open arms, and open mind, and an open heart.</p>

<p>I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and am open and ready to receive.</p>

<p>Bhavatu sabba mangalam - May all beings be happy</p>
