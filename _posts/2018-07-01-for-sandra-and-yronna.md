<p>Last week I was in Costa Rica for a family vacation. I had an amazing and wonderful time.</p>

<p>On the way back to the airport I missed a turn and needed to turn around. While I was turning around, I drove into a ditch and got completely stuck; I was literally and figuratively in a really bad spot. I walked the short distance back to the main road where I should have turned and was able to wave down a vehicle within a few minutes. The man pulled up near us and was able to attach a tow rope and pull us out of the ditch. I was so relieved and did my best to express my extreme gratitude for what he had done. Lana also got out of the car and gave the man and his wife a hug.</p>

<p>When Lana hugged the wife, she informed Lana that they had a problem and asked Lana to pray for them. So, this blog post is for Sandra and Yronna. While I'm not into prayer, religion or God, I do want to put the energy out into the Universe to help them however it can.</p>

<p>Thank you Sandra and Yronna for coming to our aid. I send you my gratitude and loving energy. I wish you as quick and helpful a solution to your problem as you provided for mine.</p>

<p>I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and am open and ready to receive.</p>

<p>Bhavatu sabba mangalam - May all beings be happy</p>

<p>And may Sandra and Yronna also receive the abundance of the Universe and be&nbsp;happy.</p>
