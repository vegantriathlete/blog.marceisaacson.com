<p>Woo hoo!</p><p>I decided that today I was finally going to ride Lookout Mountain. I took the Rooney Rd route onto the Golden trail. When I got to Johnson, I continued past my usual point where I connect with the trail around the golf course to see where that would take me. It ends in a roundabout that ultimately led me into Ford Street, which took me right to 19th Avenue. I got to 19th and Highway 93 in just under 50 minutes. Knowing that the ride down Lookout Mountain would be faster than the ride up, I decided to see how far I got riding until one hour and five minutes into the ride.</p><p>I made it a good way up the mountain, but not all the way to the top. So, I don't know how close I was when I turned around. My total ride time ended up being almost exactly two hours. It was shy by seconds.</p><p>I really enjoyed doing this route even though it is an out and back. I think it will be a great training route for me and it will be fun when the ride time increases and / or as I get faster and I can make it all the way to the top of Lookout Mountain.</p><p>I would say that the Dinosaur Ridge climb is considerably harder than the Lookout Mountain climb, but the Lookout Mountain climb is considerably longer.</p>
