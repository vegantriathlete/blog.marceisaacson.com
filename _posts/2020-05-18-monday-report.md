title: Monday's trading report

HTZ closed on Friday, May 15, 2020 at $2.63 and I was assigned on my 18 PUT contracts.
Today I placed an order to sell 18 CALL contracts of HTZ at a strike of $3.00 and a premium of $0.30 on the May 22, 2020 expiration.
It was filled immediately when the market opened at $0.35.
The opening price was $0.35.
It had a range of $0.30 - $1.05.
It had a last sold of $0.45.
The stock closed today at $3.17.

LUV closed on Friday, May 15, 2020 at $23.86 and my 4 CALLs expired worthless.
Today I placed an order to sell 4 CALLs of LUV at a strike of $27.50 and a premium of $0.30 on the May 22, 2020 expiration.
I adjusted the premium to $0.25 and was filled immediately at $0.28 at 10:39:11AM Eastern.
The opening price was $0.15.
It had a range of $0.10 - $0.30.
It had a last sold of $0.30.
The stock closed today at $27.09.

PG closed on Friday, May 15, 2020 at $114.62 and my 3 CALLs expired worthless.
Today I placed an order to sell 3 CALLs of PG at a strike price of $116 and a premium of $1.10 on the May 22, 2020 expiration and was filled immediately at $1.15 at 10:26:43AM Eastern.
The opening price was $1.30.
It had a range of $1.01 - $1.95.
It had a last sold of $1.55.
The stock closed today at $116.21.

I wasn't able to enter my orders for LUV or PG until today because it took a long time for the expired CALLs to be cleared from my account.

I'm glad to see LUV and PG make a recovery today.
It would be wonderful for them to finish the week just below my strike price.

If I get assigned on my LUV contracts at $27.50 I will end up returning most of the premiums I had collected.
My cost basis was approximately $27.21 as of today.
So, I would make $0.29 per share in the sale plus the $107.99 I collected in premiums today for a total profit of $223.99 on $12000 risked.
That would be a lower return than I had hoped for over these weeks in trading LUV.
However, given the fact that it had dropped significantly from where I bought it, I don't think I would be making out too badly.
I'll just have to wait and see what happens this week.

I'm surprised to see how much HTZ rebounded.
I do hope that it stays strong and I get assigned on the CALLs.

I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me.
I surrender and am open and ready to receive.

Bhavatu sabba mangalam - May all beings be happy
