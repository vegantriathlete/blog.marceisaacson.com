<p>Lana and I took a trip to Ouray from Thursday night through Sunday morning. (Eli stayed with his Bubbe Sue.) Ouray was beautiful, as always. We stayed in a nice little condominium and didn't use the car one time the whole time we were there. We enjoyed a couple of days of great hiking. But, the best part of the trip was listening to Terrence Real's "The New Rules of Marriage" on the drive down and back and getting to strengthen our bond with each other. We continue to work on taking our marriage from being good to great / exceptional.</p>

<p>I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and am open and ready to receive.</p>
