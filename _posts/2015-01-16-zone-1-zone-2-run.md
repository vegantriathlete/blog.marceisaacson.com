<p>The scheduled workout for today was Swim 200wu, 8X50DR, 2X250@30sec, 8X50DR, 100cd. Run 0:15 Z2.</p><p>I ran 0:15 without a HR monitor.</p><p>I really was not looking forward to the swim workout, but I didn't plan to skip it. The problem was that the pool was closed for an underwater hockey tournament (I had not paid attention to the notices that had been posted) and Green Mountain had a swim meet at their pool. I have to admit that swimming is just frustrating for me now. I'm so disappointed that I've put in so much time and don't feel I have anything to show for it. I hope that starting with the Masters swim will reenergize things and also help me to get some coaching to improve things.</p>
