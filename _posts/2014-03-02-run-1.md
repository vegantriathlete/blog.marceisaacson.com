<p>Today's workout was 60 minutes. I didn't want to run around Kendrick Lake for an hour, so I headed out for an "open" run. Consequently, I don't have any idea what my pace was as I don't know the total distance I ran.</p><p>I was still tired from the bike workout yesterday and it felt a bit chilly to me. While I was dressed perfectly fine for the weather, it took my body a bit to warm up to the run. Even still, I didn't really enjoy the workout. I don't know if it had anything to do with the workout, though. I think I may just have been cranky. But, going for a run usually helps improve my attitude no matter how it starts out. So, I'm surprised that I was just looking forward to the workout being over. This may be another sign that I am pushing my body a bit too much even though I'm staying within my target heart rate zones. Maybe I need to aim for a bit lower in the zones. I'm going to pay close attention this week. There are no "step downs" coming up in any of the next weeks' workouts.</p>
