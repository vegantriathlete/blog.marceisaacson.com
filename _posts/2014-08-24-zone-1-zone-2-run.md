excerpt: "<p>This was my eighteenth workout in my IM journey. I ran for about 70 minutes.
  My legs were a bit sore from yesterday and my hamstring did tighten up some during
  the run. So, I think it's clear that I'm not ready to increase my volume next week.
  Otherwise, the workout was fairly enjoyable.</p>"
