<p>How the week went overall: It was a mixed bag.</p><p>One thing that did not go according to plan: I did not finish compiling my punch list for "Mastering Drupal 8 Development."</p><p>One thing that went well: I made a lot of progress on projects outside of the course.</p><p>Plans for the coming week: Finish watching through the rest of the vidoes to compile the rest of the punch list. Revise the outline for the course.</p><p>Aside: I guess I never made it clear that these "Week in review" entries have been geared towards my progress on launching the course. While that's not all that my life is comprised of, it feels that way at the moment. Once I publish the class I suppose I will revisit what I'm reviewing each week.</p>
