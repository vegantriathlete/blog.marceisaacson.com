<p>I finally got out on the bike again. It is a gorgeous day today. I think the temperature was in the mid 60's. It was sunny, clear and calm.</p><p>I rode by the Carmody Rec Center to pick up one of the city's bike trail maps. Then I proceeded down to Morrison Road into Bear Creek Lake Park. I'm pretty sure I ended up on the Mt. Carbon Trail. I came out of the park, rode under C470 and then headed back up north to Alameda into Jewell.</p><p>There's really no such thing as a flat ride along the front range. I had a number of climbs and my legs are definitely feeling the workout.</p><p>Total distance according to Map My Ride was around 17 miles.</p><p>I was having lots of trouble clipping out of my pedals. Early on in the ride, I pulled over and really loosened the tension on the clips on the pedals. I wonder if my cleats are just worn out.</p><p>As it turns out, the Bear Chase Race was today. So, the path was quite busy through the Bear Creek Lake Park. It was nice to see all the people, though.</p>
