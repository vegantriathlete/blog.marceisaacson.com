<p>I've been working on my 2015 Year in Review this morning. The information is available at&nbsp;https://github.com/MarcEIsaacson/2015-Ridiculously-Open-Repository. I'm not going to repeat everything here.</p><p>I have been fighting a cold for many weeks. It's hanging on its last legs today. I think I will resume some exercise starting today.</p><p>For 2016 I'm choosing the word "Consciousness". I'm going to aim for doing a better job of documenting things as I go along. I'm not sure how I'll split things between the repository and this blog. For now, I'm going to head off to get things started for my 2016 repository!</p><p>I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and am open and ready to receive.</p><p>Bhavatu sabba mangalam - May all beings be happy</p>
