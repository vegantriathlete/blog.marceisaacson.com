<p>I swam 1600 yards and ran 30 minutes.</p><p>It had occurred to me that doing the three Sprint Tri Workouts in a row was probably not as easy as I thought it was; I wasn't getting any recovery time. So, I decided to have a look at how the Just Finish beIronfit program laid out six hours of workouts per week. It turns out that it's week nine of the program. The long ride on Saturday is 1:45 and the long run on Sunday is 1:15, which is almost exactly what I have been doing. Tuesday through Friday are very different from what I have been doing. I'm going to follow the schedule this week. Next week I'll see if I want to repeat week nine or if I want to move on to week ten.</p><p>I'm glad that I have made this change to my routine.</p>
