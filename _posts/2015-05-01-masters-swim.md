excerpt: "<p>Today's scheduled workout was a 2500 swim workout.</p><p>I did a 300
  warmup, 6 X 50 drill and swim, 10 X 50 on 1:10, 4 X 25 kick, 8 X 50 on 1:20, 4 X
  25 backstroke, 6 X 50 on 1:30, 3 X 25 one arm butterfly, 2 X 50 as fast as I could,
  1 X 75 cool down for a total of 2250m. I swam the 8 50's faster than the 10 50's
  and did my best to swim the 6 50's faster than the 8 50's. I swam about 48 or 49
  for the last 2 X 50. I was pretty tired by the time I was doing those. So, I was
  happy with those times.</p>"
