excerpt: Writing some incomplete thoughts about walking my labyrinth by the light of the almost full moon

title: By the light of the silvery moon
---
I have built a labyrinth in my backyard. Maybe I'll write another post explaining more about labyrinths. And, maybe I'll share a diagram or a photograph of my laybrinth. Right now I just want to write a few words upon having just finished walking my labyrinth in the cool early morning (from about 3:20 - 4:20) air under the bright moonlight that shone through the clear sky.

I don't really know how to convey my thoughts right now. On the one hand, I feel like I could write a whole book. On the other hand, I feel like I can't organize things well enough to even put together a blog post. I guess I'll just share some points. I'm not going to try to write a haiku, though I think that would be the ideal art form to use.

* The moon was almost full
* The sky was almost perfectly clear
* The sunlight reflected off the moon shone brightly over my labyrinth
* The air was cool, almost chilly to me
* I walked slowly through my small labyrinth; taking a step with my left foot and then my right; aligning my right foot with my left; pausing between each two steps
* As my labyrinth is oriented almost perfectly with the four points of the compass, I spent many moments facing each direction
* I looked in awe at the moon
* I looked in awe at the stars
* I looked around my backyard in complete gratitude for the beautiful surroundings in which I live
* I looked at the jungle gym I have built for my son and thought that I should make sure to spend more time playing with him on it while he is still a young child
* I listened appreciatively to the sound of my feet crunching on the crusher fine base
* I looked lovingly at the sea shells my son placed on the path
* I breathed in slowly
* I let thoughts enter and pass through my mind
* At times I felt like crying

I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and am open and ready to receive.
