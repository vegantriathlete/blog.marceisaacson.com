<p>Early this morning I decided that I had brought my custom theme far enough along that I was ready to unveil it on the site. Last week I had looked around for a WordPress theme to Drupalize, but didn't find anything that I wanted to use. I haven't figured out a good way to search for ready-made themes. It's not that I don't have links to a bunch of sites that provide them; I just haven't devised a good method to search through all the options. Of course, there are all the contributed themes on drupal.org. Anyway, I'm an independent type of person and I enjoy doing things myself.</p>
<p>I hope you like this theme. I'll be continuing to play around with it. I think it's adorable so far. Feel free to leave your comments and suggestions.</p>
