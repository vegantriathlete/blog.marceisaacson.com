excerpt: "<p>I rode the rollers for 30 minutes and then ran for 15 minutes. I had
  decided I wasn't going to worry about using the HR monitor for the bike or the run.
  However, the cadence meter was not working on the bike. So, I had to aim for the
  right cadence based on the gear and the speed I have been using on the rollers.
  I did do one check for one minute and I counted a cadence of 97 when my speed was
  22mph. Since I kept the speed somewhere just above 21 mph and the average speed
  for the workout was 20.5, I would imagine that I had my cadence in the right range."

I know I kept the right cadence for the run because I used the metronome.</p><p>The stats for the bike ride were 30 minutes 42 seconds, 10.54 miles, 20.5 mph average.</p>
