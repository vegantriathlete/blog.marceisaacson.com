excerpt: "<p>Instead of running for two hours, I took Zen for a walk for 1/2 hour
  and then walked for 1.5 hours. I didn't bring the metronome with me when I walked,
  but I did my best to aim for a cadence of 90. Walking at the high cadence definitely
  still afforded me a solid workout. I walked Jewell / Alameda / Green Mountain.</p>"
