  Cherry Creek Trail into Bear Creek Trail for about 2:10 without a HR monitor. I

  was finishing up, as the temperature had definitely increased from the time that
  I had started.</p><p>I must admit that it's a bit distressing thinking about how
  much work I have to do to be able to ride 112 miles and be ready to run a marathon
