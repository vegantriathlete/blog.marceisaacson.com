<p>I practiced in the 25 yards lanes today.</p><p>I experienced a blip in the coordination of my stroke and kick when I started the first length, so I immediately stopped and returned to the wall. Fortunately, I straightened things out without a problem.</p><p>While my sequencing of the stroke and kick was correct, something still did not feel right throughout the swim. I felt like my kick was more of a thrash than a flick. I couldn't get that corrected at any point in the practice.</p><p>But, even though I could feel that something was not right, I was able to do all 16 lengths in about 15 - 16 strokes per length. I think I might have done one length in 14 - 15 strokes. Yay!</p><p>I was breathing approximately every three strokes. I am maintaining my balance much better as I breathe to one side than the other. If I'm recalling correctly I'm breathing better to my right side. When I breathe to my left, my "weightless" arm is dropping. So, I think I probably need to focus on widening and relaxing the recovery arm.</p><p>Tomorrow I will see if I can achieve more of a flick from one side to the other. I think that if I can learn to keep my legs in a scissor position it will help with the kick. I believe that what I'm doing now is completing a kick and then bringing my legs parallel to each other.</p>
