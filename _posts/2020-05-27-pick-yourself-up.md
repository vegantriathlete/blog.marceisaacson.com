excerpt: I sold more contracts today

I was shocked to discover that HTZ was trading today.
I sold 18 CALLs on HTZ at a strike of $1.50 for a premium of $0.05 for the May 29, 2020 expiration.
HTZ closed today at $1.31.
It's hard to say whether I hope to get assigned at the end of the week or not.
If HTZ keeps on trading, of course I'd rather not get assigned at $1.50 and would prefer to be able to continue to sell CALLs.
Ideally, HTZ would stay alive and keep on climbing over time and I'd ride my CALLs back to profitability.
On the other hand, if today was just an aberration and the stock is going to become worthless, I'd be in better shape to just dump my stock for something and cut my losses.
Obviously, I can't control what's going to happen and I'll have to wait and see.

I sold 13 PUTs on HPE at a strike of $9.50 for a premium of $0.10 for the May 29, 2020 expiration.
HPE closed today at $9.75.
It would be quite nice if HPE finished the week below $9.50 (but not too much!) and I got assigned.
They declared dividends of $0.12 with an ex-dividend date of 6/8.
If I owned the stock, I would expect that I could sell CALLs at $9.50 or $10.00 next week and get a good premium.
If I didn't get assigned on the (theoretical) CALLs, I would collect the dividend.

I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me.
I surrender and am open and ready to receive.
