title: Are you an inspiration?

The following questions has been adapted from "Living an Inspired Life" by Dr. Wayne Dyer. They appear on page 129.

* Do you have a rapturous heart, sending out signals that you love the world and everyone in it?
* Are you jubilant about the work you do?
* Do you see the world as a friendly place?
* Are you at peace with yourself?
* Are you kind rather than judgemental?
* Are you confident without being boorish?
* Do you tend to be cheerful?
* Do you love to play?
* Are you elated to be in the company of young children as well as older people?
* Do you listen rather than lecture?
* Are you willing to be a student as well as a teacher?
* Do you love nature?
* Are you in awe of the world?
* Do you express rational humility?
* Are you approachable?
* Do you take great pleasure in serving others?
* Have you tamed your ego?
* Do you accept all people as equals?
* Are you open to new ideas?

I think these questions are well worth asking and keeping in our consciousness. What do you think?

I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and am open and ready to receive.
