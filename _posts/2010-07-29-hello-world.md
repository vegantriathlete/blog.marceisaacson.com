<p>Welcome to the site and welcome to my world.</p>
<p>I haven't done any personal blogging since the demise of gaia (nee zaadz). So, I figured that it was about time to launch my own blog. Plus, it gives me an excuse to launch yet another <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> site. Yeah, I know. If all I want to do is blog, then I probably should use <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>. Well, maybe I'll drupalize a WordPress theme. Right now, as you can see, I've just got the good old Garland theme up and running.</p>
<p>Anyway, you can see that I have categorized this post under rubbish. As with all such posts, I will keep things short so as not to waste too much of your time. At least this post puts something on my front page besides the installation instructions.</p>
<p>And so it begins . . .</p>
