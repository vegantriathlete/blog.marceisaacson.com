Here is an update on my orders.

My order to sell one CALL of CMCSA with an expiration of Friday, May 8, 2020 at a strike price of $36 and a premium of $0.60 was filled immediately when the market opened.
The Bid/Ask finished the day at $0.12/$0.30.
It opened at $0.60 and had a range for the day of $0.16 - $0.60.
The last sold was $0.16.
The stock closed at $35.10.
We'll have to see what happens the next couple of days and whether I even get assigned.

I adjusted my order to sell three CALLs of PG with an expiration of Friday, May 8, 2020 at a strike price of $116 and a premium of $1.05 at 10:48:24AM Eastern and it was filled immediately.
The Bid/Ask finished the day at $0.00/$0.34.
It opened at $1.10 and had a range for the day of $0.38 - $1.21.
The last sold was $0.38.
The stock closed at $113.10.
We'll have to see what happens with this stock as well over the next couple of days.

I adjusted my order to sell four CALLs of LUV with an expiration of Friday, May 8, 2020 at a strike price of $29.50 and a premium of $0.05 at 11:30:24AM Eastern.
The order Expired without being filled during the day.
The Bid/Ask finished the day at $0.00/$0.05.
It opened at $0.05 and had a range for the day of $0.02 - $0.05.
The last sold was $0.02.

I don't think I'm going to have success selling any CALLs at $30 for a while.
I'll have to decide whether I want to go down to $28.50 or if I just want to sit on the stock.
