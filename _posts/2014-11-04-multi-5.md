  a little differently. I believe I eliminated of the dead spot in my stroke in the
  lead hand. I don't know if what I was doing was right, but I did my best to keep
  both hands active through the whole stroke instead of letting the lead hand just
  hang in the water for a while. As a result, I think I rotated my body less, which
  is probably also an improvment. I'll have to see how things go as I continue to
  experiment with this small adjustment to my stroke.</p>"
