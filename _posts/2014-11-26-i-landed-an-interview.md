  campaign</a> with getting at least a little bit of client work done. So, I skipped
  my workouts yesterday and today. Fortunately, my efforts have paid off! I was the
  guest on Talking Drupal today. I think the interview went really well and I hope
  that it will help me to grow my supporter base.</p><p>I give thanks to the Universe
