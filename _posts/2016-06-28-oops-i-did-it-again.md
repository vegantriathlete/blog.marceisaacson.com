<p>Overall, I had a great time at Udemy Live. I'm definitely looking forward to attending again next year. It's not important for me to record all the details of the weekend. The highlight was getting the chance to meet fellow instructors and Udemy staff in person. The two other things that I will note are that I did end up really enjoying Oz, The Mentalist, and Seth Godin's keynote, even though I had scoffed at both of those things when they were announced.</p><p>The main thing that I want to record right now is that as I was walking back to my accommodations on Saturday night I realized that I did the same thing in my discussions with people throughout the day as I had done when I was first getting started with Drupal. I talked about my experience in a way that projected a lot of negative energy. Fortunately, I caught myself. Henceforth, I will tell my story as one of adventure and opportunity for learning and personal growth. My success to this point is measured in ways other than comparing the amount of money I've made with the amount others have made. I've gained a lot of experience with ways of doing things and have had the chance to test many assumptions and hypotheses. I'm doing so many things and using my brain in so many ways that I have not had the fortune to do previously. I'm finally taking action on something I had thought about for so long. I'm on a journey to create an entirely new way to support myself. I'm so happy to have this multi-dimensional puzzle that can engage me so fully. I am unstoppable and I will put all the puzzle pieces together in due time.</p><p>I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and am open and ready to receive.</p><p>Bhavatu sabba mangalam - May all beings be happy</p>
