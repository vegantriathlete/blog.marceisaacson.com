<p>How the week went overall: I'm going to call it a good week.</p><p>One thing that did not go according to plan: I didn't finish the revised outline for "Mastering Drupal 8 Development."</p><p>One thing that went well: I did accomplish many things, both related to the course directly and things that were not directly related to it.</p><p>Plans for the coming week: I have already made a commitment to the Content Editor at Packt to have the final outline completed by early this week.</p>
