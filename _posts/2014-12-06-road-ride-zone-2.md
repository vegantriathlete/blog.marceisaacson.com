excerpt: "<p>The bike computer didn't run the entire time I was on the ride. So I
  don't know exactly how long I rode. It was somewhere around 2:35 or 2:40. I rode
  up to the entrance for Buffalo Bill's Grave and Museum. I had intended to grind
  it out until I made it to the Lookout Mountain Nature center. But, I decided I had
  enough. I'm glad that I did turn around then. It was really cold on the way back
  down and I was very tired and hungry for a good part of the ride back.</p><p>This
  was a great workout. I think that I will both love and dread it for some time to
  come.</p>"
