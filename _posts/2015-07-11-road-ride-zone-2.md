<p>The bad news is that I blew a tube and my pump is broken. Fortunately, I got a fill from somebody with a CO2 cartridge. But, I wasn't able to complete my plan of doing two loops on the first section of the IM course.</p><p>The good news is that the workout was a total breeze for me. I rode for about 3 hours and averaged 15.2 mph for a total of about 46 miles.</p><p>I'm disappointed that I didn't get to do the second loop, which would have brought me to about 88 miles for the day. But, I'm happy that I'm disappointed as opposed to being relieved that I had an excuse to not have to do the second loop.</p><p>I'd still like to see about riding the whole 112 miles next weekend. The biggest issue is figuring out how I'm going to be able to get enough water.</p><p>Today I used the Skratch Labs lemon/lime hydration powder and found it to be great. I stopped and got off my bike where every aid station would be. I ate at every other aid station.</p><p>I'm beginning to believe that I may just be able to pull this off!</p>
