title: Yevgenia Nikolayevna Krasnova

I have finished reading "Fooled By Randomness" and am part way through "The Black Swan." I will read "Antifragile" next.

These books are part of the Incerto written by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.

I'm not going to claim to understand what Nassim is saying. I am amused by him and I like how he summarized "The Black Swan."

    The chairman of [insert here your company’s name] is a lucky fellow who happened to be in the right place at the right time and claims credit for the company’s success, without making a single allowance for luck.

I'm also doing my best to become more conscious of how I fall prey to the fallibilities Nassim writes about, as well as to consider how I might put his ideas into practice. Nassim is not the first author I've read who points out how little people know and how that stands in marked contrast to how much we think we know.

I didn't immediately conduct a search on Yevgenia Nikolayevna Krasnova upon finishing chapter two of "The Black Swan." As that chapter was only about two pages' worth of text, I just continued right on to chapter three and immediately noticed the footnote.

    * To those readers who Googled Yevgenia Krasnova, I am sorry to say that she is (officially) a fictional character.

When I first read about Nero Tulip, I must admit that I did assume he was an actual person, though with an unusual name. I'm ashamed to say how long it took me to make the connection between his initials and those of Nassim Taleb. Perhaps I am as think as some people slow I am. It is interesting how in "Fooled By Randomness" Nassim writes that Nero died in a helicopter crash, noting that the Black Swan got its man, but how in "The Black Swan" Nero doesn't actually die in a helicopter crash. He does, however, have a brief flirtation with Yevgenia, causing her to leave one of her husbands. Alas, Nero decides at some point that he's tired of her and he moves on.

So, what about "The Desert of the Tartars" (aka, Il deserto dei tartari, The Tartar Steppe) by Dino Buzzati? I had to wonder if that was an actual book written by an actual author. It appears that this is, in fact, not only an actual book by an actual author, but has also been made into a movie. Is Nassim recommending that we read that book? Has he read it? Does he like it? Is it an example of how we should live our lives or is it an example of how we should not live our lives?

Would Nassim agree with the idea of spending $1 on a lottery ticket each week? Is this a good way to accumulate small losses while allowing for the possibility of being positively affected by a Black Swan event?

What strategy did (does?) Nassim use in his trading?

I must say that I am experiencing the sensation that the more I read it seems like the less I know.

I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and am open and ready to receive.
