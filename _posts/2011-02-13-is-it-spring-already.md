<p>I don't know what the ground hog predicted recently. But, I can tell you that today it was around 63 degrees and sunny when I went snow shoeing with Lana around the reservoir behind our house.</p>
<p>I'm so glad that we got the much needed precipitation. And I'm so glad that we get these warm sunny days. I must admit that I would have liked to have been wearing not just a t-shirt, but shorts as well. That was quite a workout going around the reservoir twice, the first time with the doggies and the second time sans canine companions.</p>
<p>I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and am open and ready to receive.</p>
