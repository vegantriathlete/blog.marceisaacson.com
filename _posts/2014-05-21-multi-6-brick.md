excerpt: "<p>I rode&nbsp;easy&nbsp;for 30 minutes at a cadence of 90 rpm and then
  ran easy for 15 minutes at a cadence of 90.</p><p>My bike computer reported an average
  speed of 15.4 mph.</p><p>The transition from the bike to the run was perfectly smooth;
  it didn't take any time for my legs to adjust. I don't know if the easy transition
  carries much significance, though, because I didn't bike for very long or very hard.
  And, since I don't think I have been commenting about the transition in any of the
  previous bricks I can't say whether this is any different.</p>"
