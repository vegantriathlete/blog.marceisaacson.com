excerpt: <p>I swam 100 X 25 yds. By the end I was definitely choppier and did not
  feel the same sense of forward momentum. I think that I was taking 1 - 2 more strokes
  per length as well.</p><p>I'm glad to have finally turned my "long swim" day into
  a longer swim. This will also be good preparation for when I start the Masters swim
  in January.</p>
