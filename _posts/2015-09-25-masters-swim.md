excerpt: "<p>This was the last Friday of the month, so I swam in a different lane
  with some different lane mates. As a result, I pretty much did the workout on my
  own while my lane mates did whatever they chose to do. I needed just a little extra
  time at the end to finish the 200m cooldown that brought to the workout total of
  2250m. I did a fair amount of all four strokes during the course of the workout.</p>"
