excerpt: "<p>I completed my first Masters Swim workout this morning! I don't have
  much noteworthy to report. I got to the workout on time (5:30AM) and swam for the
  full hour following the workout the coach prescribed. In the last 10 minutes of
  the workout I was supposed to practice dolphin kicking, but the coach had me swim
  200 meters crawl so he could check out my form. He said that my form was pretty
  good overall. The only issue he pointed out was that my hand entry was too close
  to the center line; he wants me to keep my hand more at shoulder width.</p>"

<p>I completed my first Masters Swim workout this morning! I don't have much noteworthy to report. I got to the workout on time (5:30AM) and swam for the full hour following the workout the coach prescribed. In the last 10 minutes of the workout I was supposed to practice dolphin kicking, but the coach had me swim 200 meters crawl so he could check out my form. He said that my form was pretty good overall. The only issue he pointed out was that my hand entry was too close to the center line; he wants me to keep my hand more at shoulder width.</p><p>I weighed in at about 131 pounds after the workout. I was drinking water during the workout, so I think that the weight is pretty reflective of my normal weight.</p><p>I'm so glad to be able to pick up my exercise routine and my IM Quest again!</p><p>I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and am open and ready to receive.</p>
