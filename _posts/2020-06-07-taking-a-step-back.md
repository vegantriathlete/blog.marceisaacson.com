excerpt: It's important to maintain a wide enough perspective
title: I am taking a step back

I have been filling up this blog with posts about my trading activity.
There are more important things to talk about.

Yesterday my family went to a Black Lives Matter protest / march in downtown Denver.
(This action was an important decision to be the change we want to see in the world.)

I received my promotion to CL7 effective June 1, 2020.
(This promotion is less important to consider than the fact that a human being was brutally murdered by a police officer simply because of the color of the victim's skin.)

My family is still healthy.
(This fact is more noteworthy than my promotion and especially poignant against the backdrop of what has been happening to Black families.)

It's important that I mention all of those things (and probably many more) before I resume my writing about my trading activity.

So, I'll keep my notes about my trading equally as short as the points I made above.

In just shy of two month's worth of trading, I have effectively broken even:
Almost all the money I made in premiums has been returned in losses on getting assigned on CALLs of the shares I acquired through PUTs.
I have severely underperformed what the market did during that time.
(These facts are almost entirely insignificant.)

I'm going to take a short breather while I organize myself again.

I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me.
I surrender and am open and ready to receive.
