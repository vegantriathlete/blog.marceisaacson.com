excerpt: "<p>I rode for 30 minutes on the Cybex upright bike using the heart rate
  program at 135bpm for a total of 8.38 miles. I was surprised that my mileage was
  greater today than yesterday's mileage because I was talking to somebody while I
  was riding and I think I maintained a higher cadence. I thought the higher cadence
  would result in a higher heart rate which would cause the bike to use a lower gear
  and thus generate a slower speed. I know that in previous workouts it seemed clear
  that bringing my cadence down somewhat resulted in a higher speed.</p>"

<p>I rode for 30 minutes on the Cybex upright bike using the heart rate program at 135bpm for a total of 8.38 miles. I was surprised that my mileage was greater today than yesterday's mileage because I was talking to somebody while I was riding and I think I maintained a higher cadence. I thought the higher cadence would result in a higher heart rate which would cause the bike to use a lower gear and thus generate a slower speed. I know that in previous workouts it seemed clear that bringing my cadence down somewhat resulted in a higher speed.</p><p>So, there are a couple of things of interest (although not necessarily surprising). I was able to maintain a higher cadence while I was talking to somebody. The higher cadence apparently resulted in a faster speed. I'm not going to analyze these tidbits very much since this is just one set of data points and my heart rate could be a confounding factor; maybe it was just running lower today. I can't know what I would have done if I hadn't ridden with a somewhat higher cadence. Maybe I would have ridden at an even faster speed because the bike could have geared up more. It's no surprise that talking to somebody while I rode made the workout seem easier and pass faster.</p>
