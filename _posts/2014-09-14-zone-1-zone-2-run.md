excerpt: "<p>I was looking forward to doing this workout. I wasn't feeling tired from
  the previous workouts in the week. I did start to feel tired pretty early in the
  workout, though. But, it was still an enjoyable workout. I think that it makes sense
  for me to spend one more week doing the same workout routine. I'd like to see if
  I can make it all the way through the end of the long run still feeling strong and
  relaxed.</p>"
