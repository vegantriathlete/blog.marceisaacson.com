<p>I was vacationing in the Midwest from May 8 - May 18. I was busy before the trip working on getting as much done for my clients as I could. It looks like I didn't get in a workout on Tuesday or Wednesday. I did drop off my bikes for a tune up on Monday and retrieved them on Wednesday.</p><p>I went for a 30 minute run on Friday and Saturday. On Sunday I rode a stationary bike for 30 minutes and ran for 30 minutes. I can't remember if I did a 30 minute run on Monday. I'm sure that I did not get in a workout on Tuesday. I did a 30 minute run on Wednesday. On Thursday I did a tough 30 minute run. I went out for 20 minutes uphill, then turned around and ran back downhill for 12 minutes to the start. Friday I did a 30 minute run / walk / hike. I did an easy hike on Saturday. I did not get in a workout on Sunday.</p><p>Today I swam 25X100 yards easy at 1.30 seconds per stroke. Then I ran easy at a cadence of 90 for about 35 minutes.</p>
