<p>I ran 5 loops (miles) around Kendrick Lake. I think the first loop was at a 9:10 pace and I think I got faster throughout the workout. The strap on the heart rate monitor was too loose and I didn't want to spend the 45 minutes tugging on the strap again. So, I let it slide down.</p><p>I would have been happy with a 10:00 pace for today's workout since I was still tired from yesterday's bike workout.</p><p>It's nice to see that I'm already at 19% of the IM Distance run leg. It's interesting that the 1600 yard straight swim I did a couple of Friday's ago is already almost 38% of the IM Distance swim leg. Nineteen percent of the IM Distance bike leg is 21.28 miles. Assuming I maintained a 17mph pace for the bike workout yesterday, I would have done 21.25 miles. But, I'm pretty sure that my average pace was slower than that. I would guess that yesterday's bike workout was in between 18 and 19% of the IM Distance bike leg. I'm actually surprised that the bike and run are so comparable.</p>
