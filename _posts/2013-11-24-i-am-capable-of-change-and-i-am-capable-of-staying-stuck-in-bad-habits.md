<p>Maybe I'm just procrastinating and wasting time reading through my older blog entries because I'm feeling tired right now. However, upon reading my entry about <a href="/blog/2010/11/28/do-we-ever-really-change">eating too much at the all-you-can-eat-buffet</a> I had an idea for this entry I'm writing now.</p><p>I have been following the 5/2 Diet for a fair amount of time now. Mondays and Thursdays are my days. One recent Thursday, in the past month or so, I had a lunch meeting with clients. We met at Souper!Salad! While I'm sure I didn't limit myself to just 200 calories, I really did do a great job of eating just a modest amount of food, stopping before I was even truly full. I felt so good about myself in exercising such excellent restraint.</p><p>On the other hand, I still continue to overeat on lots of other occasions. I think part of the issue lately, is that I have been so hungry from all the additional exercise I've been doing. While I am thinking that I need to switch to a 6/1 Diet, I still need to get much better at pushing myself away from the table sooner on my "6" days. I need to learn that it's better to walk away before I'm completely full and have another small meal in as soon as another hour than to stuff too much in trying to completely squelch the sense of hunger.</p><p>I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and am open and ready to receive.</p><p>Bhavatu, sabba, mangalam -- May all beings be happy.</p>
