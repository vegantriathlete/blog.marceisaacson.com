<p>I did a "free" run for one hour. Today the weather was absolutely gorgeous.</p><p>I don't have any idea what my total mileage was. I looped out quite a bit too far and had a decent walk back home at the end (from Kipling and Jewell).</p><p>I still don't find the run to be enjoyable. It's hard work that requires me to maintain my determination to stick with it.</p><p>As much as it was in my control I kept my heart rate a bit lower by pulling back my pace. But, there were sections that were just too steep for me to keep my heart rate in range. I suppose that I could have just walked those parts.</p><p>I'm pretty tired right now. I don't think the fact that I was up twice (it was actually more like just one long time since the second was within about ten minutes or so of the first) early in the morning with Eli helps anything.</p>
