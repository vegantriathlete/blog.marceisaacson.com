<p>How the week went overall: I have to say that I was far less productive than I had planned to be. I thought I had the pieces in place to get a lot done during the week.</p><p>One thing that did not go according to plan: I certainly hadn't planned to let all of Monday go by without getting anything done. I had to rescue it a bit in the last 30 minutes of the day.</p><p>One thing that went well: I had a great lunch date with a friend. We discussed job hunting and technology. I'm looking forward to continuing the discussion with him.</p><p>Plans for the coming week: I want to start / finish the Modal API section of my "Mastering Drupal 8 Development" course. I still need to set more goals for the week.</p><p>I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and am open and ready to receive.</p><p>Bhavatu sabba mangalam - May all beings be happy</p>
