excerpt: I had to adjust my premiums
title: Monday's trading report
---
My order to sell 18 PUT contracts of HTZ at a strike of $3.00 and a premium of $0.25 on the May 15, 2020 expiration was filled immediately when the market opened.
The opening price was $0.25.
It had a range of $0.20 - $0.33.
It had a last sold of $0.23.
If I let my original premium of $0.30 stand I might have gotten filled at some point during the day.
But, I don't know if all 18 contracts would have been filled.
I think it was good call to ensure that I got filled at $0.25.

My order to sell 4 CALLs of LUV at a strike of $30 and a premium of $0.15 on the May 15, 2020 expiration was partially filled immediately when the market opened.
I sold 2 of the 4 contracts.
I changed the premium to $0.10 at 9:52:15AM Eastern.
Then I changed the premium to $0.05 at 10:03:39AM Eastern.
I got filled at $0.06 at 10:03:40AM Eastern.
The opening price was $0.15.
It had a range of $0.05 - $0.15.
It had a last sold of $0.05.

I adjusted my order to sell 3 CALLs of PG at a strike price of $116 and a premium of $1.60 on the May 15, 2020 expiration to $1.40 at 09:50:38AM Eastern.
I adjusted it to $1.25 at 09:58:24AM Eastern.
I adjusted it to $1.15 at 10:02:24AM Eastern and it was filled immediatly.
The opening price was $1.36.
It had a range of $1.02 - $1.42.
It had a last sold of $1.06.

I'm glad that I was clear that I wanted to ensure I sold all my contracts today.
That clarity made it easy for me to make the adjustments early in the morning.
While I could have theoretically gotten a higher premium on some contracts, I think it's better that I took quick action.

I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me.
I surrender and am open and ready to receive.

Bhavatu sabba mangalam - May all beings be happy
