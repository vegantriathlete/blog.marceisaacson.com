<p>This was my seventeenth workout in my IM journey. I wanted to ride out to the C470 trail again and head East. I went directly South on Kipling to get to the trail. That part of the workout took me about 50 minutes. So, I didn't have to much time to be able to head East before I had to start making my way back home. I ended up riding about two hours.</p><p>The bike (sidewalk) path down Kipling was much better than the one I ended up on Pierce and Wadsworth. However, once I get stronger even the path on Kipling won't really be suitable. But, I've probably got a good while before I'm at that point.</p><p>I'll see how I feel after tomorrow's workout, but I can pretty much already tell that I should stay with the same workout volume next week as I have been doing for the past few weeks. This week I had even decreased the total time some on account of the way I switched the Tuesday through Thursday workouts and I would say that I didn't feel totally recovered at the start of this workout.</p><p>I did think that I felt stronger on the Estes hill.</p>
