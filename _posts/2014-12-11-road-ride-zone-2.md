  Green Mountain. But, I still ended up getting a small amount of climbing. I think
  that all in all it was a pretty good balance of an easier workout while still giving
  a bit of strength building.</p><p>The route was down Garrison (scenice route to
  Garrison via Lee street through Kendrick Lake Park) all the way to the 285 frontage
  road, across to Kipling and back up Kipling to Addenbrooke Park, then back down
  Garrison.</p>"
