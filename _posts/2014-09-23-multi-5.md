<p>My hamstring was hurting and I felt tired heading out to this workout. So, I planned to just keep it super easy and make my way through it.</p><p>I reduced the seconds per stroke to 1.18. This faster tempo certainly did change the feel of the workout. But, I was still able to maintain a relaxed enough effort that I didn't wear myself out doing the workout. I swam for about 30 minutes. On the last 25 yards I counted my strokes and it took me about 25. So, the stroke length definitely has decreased with the increased stroke rate. But, I still think it's a good idea to continue working at the higher stroke rate.</p><p>The run ended up being a lot of fun. When I started the run, it was okay. But, somewhere into the run I started to feel really good. The jog up the Garrison hill was actually quite fun. I felt on top of the world by the time I finished my 30 minutes of running.</p>
