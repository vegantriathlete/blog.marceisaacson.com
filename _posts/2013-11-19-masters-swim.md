I asked him for more clarification, as that is what Scott had told me last week. I wanted to make sure that it wasn't an issue with me swimming using the TI method. In fact, it's not. On the contrary, when Jim explained to me what I needed to do to correct it, it aligned perfectly with what TI teaches. The issue arises when I am rolling for my breath. I am not maintaining my arm reach.</p>
