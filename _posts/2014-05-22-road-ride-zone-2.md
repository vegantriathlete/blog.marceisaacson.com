excerpt: "<p>I rode for about one hour and fifteen minutes. I thought that I was taking
  a route that was easier than the Morrison Road / Alameda one. But, I guess that
  living in the foot hills means that there are no easy routes heading west. I took
  Jewell / Alameda / C470 / Route 6.</p><p>The bike computer reported an average speed
  of 12.9 mph (sad trombone). I still enjoyed the ride, though. It was great to get
  out in the morning and start my day with the ride.</p>"
