I'm sorry to say that I have to admit defeat in the war against the spammers. I have been unable to take any automated measures to keep the site free from spam, and it has become too time consuming to keep deleting the spam comments.

If you wish to leave a comment on the site, you will need to request an account. To request an account on the site you need to navigate to blog [dot] marceisaacson [dot] com [slash] user [slash] register. Please accept my sincere apologies for this inconvenience. Rest assured that I am not trying to harvest email addresses so that I can spam people or sell those addresses to others.

If I can free up some time somewhere down the road, I may investigate other steps I can take to keep the spam comments at bay and may reinstitute anonymous commenting.
