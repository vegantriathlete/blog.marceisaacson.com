<p>Today's scheduled workout was a 2500 swim workout and Run 1:00 Z2 with a 15 minute pickup at 0:40.</p><p>I was exhausted yesterday and last night Zen got me up and I had trouble falling back asleep. I came downstairs around 2:30 am and took a while to fall asleep on the couch. When my alarm went of at 4:30 I decided that I needed to get more sleep. We had carpeting installed today and the worker finished in the afternoon.</p><p>I ended up deciding to do a shortened swim and run workout. I swam for about 30 minutes and ran for about 30 minutes. I kept it an easy effort. I did a mixture of things for the swim workout and just kept the whole run an easy pace.</p>
