excerpt: "<p>I headed west on Jewell into Alameda and up and over Dinosaur Ridge.
  I made my way to Heritage Square and onto the trail that runs along Highway 6. I
  made my way back by taking Rooney Road. So, I have found my way that I can connect
  with a set of trails that will get me to 19th Street and Lookout Mountain.</p><p>This
  was a hard but enjoyable ride and the weather was great. I think it was probably
  in the low 70's.</p>"
