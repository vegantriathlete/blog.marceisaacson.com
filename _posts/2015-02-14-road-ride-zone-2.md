I was on my way back and saw that I was going to come up short by about 10 minutes when I was at 14th and Garrison. So, I took a ride on the path along the light rail and ended up making my way to 6th and Union.</p><p>I took a pretty spectacular fall at Kipling and Florida. I had stopped for the light and pressed the button. When I started to set my front wheel down into the street from the curb, it got stuck and I ended up going over the handle bars. Fortunately, there was absolutely no harm done to the bike or myself.</p>
