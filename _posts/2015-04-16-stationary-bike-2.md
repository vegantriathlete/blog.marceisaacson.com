excerpt: "<p>Today's scheduled workout was Bike 1:00 Z2 with a 7.5 minute pickup at
  0:45.</p><p>The weather was not conducive to riding outside, so I headed to the
  fitness center to use the stationary bike. For the pickup I geared up two higher
  for 3 minutes and then backed down to just one higher for the next 4.5 minutes.
  Pushing even 150 Watts is pretty hard for me. I did my best to keep it somewhere
  around 200Watts for the first three minutes of the pickup. The next 4.5 was somewhere
  around 150. The rest of the workout was in the range of 90 - 100 Watts.</p>"
