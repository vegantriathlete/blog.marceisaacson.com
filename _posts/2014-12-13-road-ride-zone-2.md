excerpt: "<p>I rode up to Buffalo Bill's grave again today. I enjoyed the workout
  quite a bit. I don't know how long the ride took me because I had to wait to cross
  6th Avenue too long on the way back and I didn't realize that the computer had stopped.
  But, I think I was a bit slower today than last week. I think my body needs to get
  used to the increased work load I've taken on with the swim and the bike.</p>"
