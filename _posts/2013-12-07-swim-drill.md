<p>Heading to today's practice I was looking forward to playing in the water more. But, this practice was harder than yesterday's. I think my legs were tired from kicking yesterday.</p><p>I had to concentrate a lot harder today. I think that after I rotated to breathe I tended to be over-rotated as I went back into skate. On the other hand I think that when I went from Superman glide into skate I did a much better job of hitting the correct skate position without having to twiddle around.</p><p>At some point in the workout I noticed that I was feeling tired. My first thought was that I just needed to keep on pushing through. But, then it struck me that if I was tired then it was time to stop. There is no point in (risking) ingraining bad technique. So, I think relatively closely to when I realized I was getting tired I did stop. As it turns out that ended up being pretty close to 30 minutes.</p><p>Just for fun I decided to go to the deep end to experience some vertical kicking. I don't have anything remarkable to report on the experience. And, it probably wasn't the ideal experience given that I was already tired. I'm glad that I did it though.</p><p>I think the key point for me to learn from today's practice is: don't struggle and don't suffer. I'm sure that I'm going to need more reminders about this as I've become totally acculturated to the philosophy that you must work hard and push through obstacles to achieve anything. It's going to take me time to be able to approach things in a more zen-like fashion.</p><p>Note to self: Once you start to sense that you are tired and losing your focus and / or technique, the swim practice is officially over. Stop immediately, no matter how long (or short) you have been at it.</p>
