excerpt: Recording this time in history
title: The new normal - COVID-19
---
Lakewood's facilities have been closed to the public for the past few weeks.

People have been hoarding supplies, including toilet paper.

Concerts and sporting events have been canceled across the country.

Accenture has ordered all its employees to work remotely.

The entire state of Colorado went on lockdown on Thursday, March 26.

Congress passed a 2.2 trillion dollar stimulus package, the CARES Act.

Gasoline is around $1.75 a gallon in my neighborhood.

Unemployment is soaring as businesses have to lay off workers.

Yesterday we got the message that many of us have been expecting would come:
Jefferson County students will be continuing remote learning for the remainder of the school year.
While this eventuality is not a surprise, it still is a bit unsettling to know that it is actually happening.

Also, yesterday Governor Polis issued a recommendation that everybody in Colorado wear a mask when we go out in public.

There is one model that has been cited a lot recently that predicts Colorado will reach its peak near the middle of the month.

I also want to sadly note that the perception of the seriousness of this global pandemic is split strongly along party lines in the United States.
Republicans, particularly Trump supporters, continue to state that this is no worse than the flu and it's being totally blown out of proportion.

We are living in a historically significant time and only time will tell how all of this plays out.

I do hope that there will be something good that results from going through this experience.

I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me.
I surrender and am open and ready to receive.

Bhavatu sabba mangalam - May all beings be happy
