excerpt: "<p>Today's scheduled workout was Swim 1600.</p><p>My glute was still very
  sore this morning. But, I didn't want to miss another workout and I figured I could
  handle an easy swim. I'm really glad that I did get to the pool. I think I did 1950:
  200 wu crawl, 100 dolphin kick on back with fins, 3 X (100 one-arm fly with fins,
  100 breast, 100 crawl), 200 pull, 50 dolphin kick on back, 300 cd crawl.</p>"

<p>Today's scheduled workout was Swim 1600.</p><p>My glute was still very sore this morning. But, I didn't want to miss another workout and I figured I could handle an easy swim.

For the fifth set, I was going to do another 100 dolphin kick on back, but it felt like my legs were tired.</p><p>I think my glute feels much looser now.</p>
