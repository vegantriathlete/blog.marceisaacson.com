<p>The scheduled workout for today is Run 0:30 Z1 - Z2.</p><p>I didn't bother wearing a HR monitor since I'm confident that I can keep it in that range without a problem. I ran 0:30.</p><p>I'm definitely fighting an illness right now. So, I'm glad that I'm back at the beginning of the program and I didn't have a 90 minute run today.</p><p>I took a Cold-Eze this morning. I also took a packet of emergen-c just now.</p><p>I'm sure that I brought this on in large part to my lack of sleep last week pushing to get more of the Udemy course done. No more missing sleep for me! It doesn't help that Eli had the flu this weekend as well.</p>
