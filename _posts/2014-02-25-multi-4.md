excerpt: "<p>I did my warmup in the slow lane today. Then I did the workout in the
  next lane over. I needed to make a few adjustments to hang on with the group. On
  the 3X400m set I did 3X300m. On a drill / swim set I shortened up the drill on the
  last couple of repeats. On a set where the rest of the swimmers used fins for just
  part of the set, I used the fins more. With these adjustments I was able to swim
  with the group without disrupting anybody.</p>"

<p>I did my warmup in the slow lane today. Then I did the workout in the next lane over. I needed to make a few adjustments to hang on with the group. On the 3X400m set I did 3X300m. On a drill / swim set I shortened up the drill on the last couple of repeats. On a set where the rest of the swimmers used fins for just part of the set, I used the fins more. With these adjustments I was able to swim with the group without disrupting anybody.</p><p>I ended up swimming all four strokes in the workout today, accepting the fact that my 50m "butterfly" was just the dolphin kick with fins. I did do a total of 100m breaststroke, which I would say I did a reasonbly good job of faking. I think I swam 150m backstroke.</p><p>I will definitely continue to swim in lane 2.</p><p>I ran 58 laps in 30.25 minutes, which equates to about an 8:20 pace.</p>
