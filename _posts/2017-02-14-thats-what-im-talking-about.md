<p>Yes! I just submitted the last video in the Web Services section of my "Mastering Drupal 8 Development" course. I'm planning to move into the "Creating a Custom Theme" section next.</p><p>I'm so glad that I persisted on Sunday afternoon to figure out the issue that was holding me hostage. My accomplishments on Sunday set me up well to keep on rolling on Monday and today I just kept on charging ahead.</p><p>Now I've just got to keep up the momentum the rest of this week :) I've still lots of time left to complete more of the course.</p><p>For the moment I'm just going to allow myself to feel a bit of pride and satisfaction. I'm going to get the dog out for a walk and then head to my workout.</p><p>(p.s.: Eli got a spot at Rooney Ranch Elementary, which was Lana's first choice for him to attend.)</p><p>I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and am open and ready to receive.</p><p>Bhavatu sabba mangalam - May all beings be happy</p>
