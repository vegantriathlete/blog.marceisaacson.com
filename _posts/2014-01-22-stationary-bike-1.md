excerpt: <p>I rode for 30 minutes. I had to use a different brand / model bike today
  so the stats can't be compared directly to what I've done on the other workouts.
  This was one of the Cybex bikes. It doesn't provide me a summary function. So, I've
  got to provide my best estimate of the stats. I rode in "gear" 7 at around 94rpm,
  producing around 100 watts at a heart rate in the range of 134 bpm and a speed of
  about 16.8 mph.</p>
