excerpt: I'm picking up a non-technology skill
title: Learning something new in isolation
---
Many people are looking for ways to occupy themselves online during this period of self-isolation.
I've actually been spending some time learning something new away from the computer.

Over the past couple of weeks I have spent some time on our trampoline with Eli, when the weather allows.
(This is Colorado and the weather tends to be pretty bipolar switching between Winter and Spring.)
I finally decided that I want to learn to do a flip.
I'd love to do a backflip at some point.
And while it's supposed to be easier to land a back flip than a front flip, I'm still too scared to approach a back flip.

I was pretty scared to approach the front flip initially as well.
At first I had to get comfortable just falling down on the net.
Then I progressed to bending down and flipping myself over onto my back.
Eventually I was willing to stand upright and flip, though I was not prepared to fully commit to it.

That initial practice was pretty uncomfortable, as I stayed pretty tense.
Now I'm at the point that I'm actually willing to commit to the flip and not tense up so much.
The soreness I end up feeling is just from exertion and using my muscles so differently.
My main challenge now is not fear of doing the flip, but of figuring out just how much rotation to aim for.
I find that I do need to leverage the bounce that the trampoline gives me, but I've got to make sure that I don't get too much energy going or I end up over-rotating and I fall forward after my feet hit.
I would guess I'm landing the flip somewhere in the range of 10% to 20%.

I hope that once I can consistently land the front flip I will build the courage (and the wisdom!) to be able to do a back flip.

I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me.
I surrender and am open and ready to receive.
