  to spare before I had to pick up Eli. I rode up Jewell to Alameda, down Green Mountain
  to Union, up Mississippi to Alameda, across Alameda to Green Mountain back down
  to Wright and back up Mississippi. That route took about an hour and I definitely
  got in a good 5 minute push up Mississippi into Alameda across to Green Mountain.</p><p>Then
  I still had the ride home after picking up Eli.</p><p>This worked out (no pun intended)
  well.</p>"
