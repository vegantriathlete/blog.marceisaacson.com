<p>This was a quick transition workout. I rode for about thirty minutes on the bike and then ran for about fifteen minutes.</p><p>It was pretty hot during the workout and I definitely felt it during the run. But, the workout was good overall.</p><p>I'm glad that I transition from the bike to the run so smoothly; I have not experienced the stiffness / crampiness in my legs (that I can remember) at all. It may be on account of the fact that I'm not pushing hard on the bike or the run. But, even with easy efforts on the two disciplines I think that it's still possible to experience that period of the muscles in the legs adjusting. So, I'm hopeful that I will continue to have easy transitions even when I pick up the intensity.</p>
