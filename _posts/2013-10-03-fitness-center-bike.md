<p>I had a choice to make this morning. When I woke up I felt a little bit of a sore throat and a stuffy nose. Am I getting sick? Am I already sick? Should I take the day off?</p><p>The fact that I'm so early in the program and really just in the pre-base phase makes it a non-issue to miss one workout. On the other, since I am so early in the process, the workouts are still quite easy. So, it's not like it taxes my body tremendously. Given that the workout for today was only fifteen minutes in Zone 2 on the bike, I decided to do it.</p><p>Tomorrow's workout is another of the Fitness Center Multi #1, which is more challenging overall and more time consuming. Today is also one of my "2" days in the 5:2 diet. So, I hope that tomorrow I'm not sorry that I decided to workout today. It would actually be better for me to miss today's workout and make tomorrow's. I'll just have to see how it goes now.</p><p>The workout went well for me and, at this point, I do feel good about deciding to do it. Here are the stats: Speed - 15.5; Cadence - 99; HR - 137. I believe that I remembered to set the gear to four (as I had done yesterday).</p><p>I'm thinking that my cadence may be just a bit too high. Next workout I will see how it feels to use gear five and bring the cadence down to 90 (or whatever feels comfortable in that gear). I'm going to have to experiment in order to be able to determine the right mixture of cadence and gear. I don't know how a cadence of 80 would work for me. I probably should give that a try at some point. But, for right now, I'm guessing that it's better for me to aim for higher cadence to keep the focus on cardio (as opposed to muscle) power and to build good technique.</p>
