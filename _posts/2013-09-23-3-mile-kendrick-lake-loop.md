<p>I think it was right around 50 degrees and very windy this morning. It worked out okay for me to head out in my shorts and t-shirt. I was maybe just a little bit cool and probably would have been too warm if I wore a windbreaker.</p><p>Yesterday I had talked to a neighbor whose son had recently completed an ultra-marathon (50 miles) and who had paced someone who had completed the Leadville 100. It might make sense for me to think about doing an ultra-marathon prior to the IM. But, I don't think it makes sense for me to do the Leadville 100. Not really knowing what a reasonable time estimate would be for me to finish either, I would just guess that I should be able to complete the 50 miles in 10 hours at most and would probably need to figure that the 100 miles would definitely take 20 hours. Since I am aiming to finish the IM in 12 hours or fewer, I can't see how competing in a 20 hour race would be beneficial; that can be something for me to target after completing the IM Quest.</p><p>I still haven't replaced the inner tube on the rear tire of my bike. The bike is in the basement on the repair stand. I really need to think about getting out for another bike ride soon, though. And, I can't let this many days pass again without getting out for some type of workout, be it run or bike. I've got to think about getting swim workouts going some time soon, too.</p>
