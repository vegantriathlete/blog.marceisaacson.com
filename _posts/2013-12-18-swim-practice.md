<p>My kick was better today than yesterday. It was definitely less of a thrash and closer to a flick. But, I'm still not feeling a fluid switch or any type of a surge when I switch. I came closer to maintaining a scissor-like orientation of my legs and would like to continue to focus on fine tuning it.</p><p>My breathing was better today. I felt much more of a sensation of having a weightless arm and being able to just glide along patiently as I took my breath.</p><p>Each length took 15 strokes. I was still a bit shy of the wall on my 14th stroke and had to take that one additional stroke.</p><p>I think that I'm still thrusting my arms into the water at least a little bit. But, I also think that I did a good job overall of keeping my forearm and hand relaxed. With all the focus I am putting on my legs and my kick right now, I'm probably not putting quite enough focus on making sure that my fingers are always pointed to the bottom of the pool.</p><p>I was satisfied with what I was able to accomplish in my practice today and think that it's going to be a matter of time in the water for my brain and body to work out some of the nuances in the stroke. I think I'm on the right track.</p>
