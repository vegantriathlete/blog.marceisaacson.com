excerpt: "<p>This was my nineteenth workout in my IM journey. I swam for about five
  minutes, biked for about twenty seven minutes and ran for about eighteen minutes.
  Since it was raining (and around 7:15 pm and getting dark) I ran on the treadmill.
  There's nothing remarkable to report. I definitely prefer being able to ride and
  run outside. The tour rides on the Expresso bike make it a bit more enjoyable and
  easier to deal with riding on a stationary bike. I would imagine that once I add
  some intervals and other changes to the workouts it will be better still."

<p>This was my nineteenth workout in my IM journey. I swam for about five minutes, biked for about twenty seven minutes and ran for about eighteen minutes. Since it was raining (and around 7:15 pm and getting dark) I ran on the treadmill. There's nothing remarkable to report. I definitely prefer being able to ride and run outside. The tour rides on the Expresso bike make it a bit more enjoyable and easier to deal with riding on a stationary bike. I would imagine that once I add some intervals and other changes to the workouts it will be better still. Likewise, I think running on the treadmill will be more tolerable once I add a bit of variety in the workout. But for now it's good that I am keeping things at a very low intensity.</p>
