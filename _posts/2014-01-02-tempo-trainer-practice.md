<p>I swam 22 X 50 yards @ 1.40 seconds per stroke today.</p><p>Even filtering out the obvious outliers from when I didn't punch out the lap time on the first try, there is a clear positive slope to the best-fit line of my times. Once again my best time was the first repeat. I didn't do anything special or put any additional effort into it, but it was better than my last repeat (which wasn't my slowest) by almost 6 seconds. So, it might be reasonable to consider that first repetition an outlier as well. But, my second and third repetitions were four seconds faster than my last.</p><p>I don't think I should swim at more than 1.40 seconds per stroke, though. If anything, I think this is a bit too slow. I feel like breathing on every third stroke is too much time in between breaths. I think I will try 1.38 at the next workout, although there would also be merit in seeing if I could relax more at 1.40 (see note below) so that I'm not as hungry for oxygen.</p><p>My strokes per length on the way out held pretty steady at between 17 and 18. There were maybe a couple that went to 19. My strokes per length on the way back were around 19 - 20. There may have been one or two that I completed in 18 and one or two that took me more like 21.</p><p>Something that I became more aware of towards the end of the workout and tried to practice was having a softer feel. I think that I'm needlessly wasting energy when I'm pushing more. I can't say exactly what's softer versus harder. But, I think it has to do with how I kick and how my hand enters the water. Besides thinking of it feeling softer I would describe it as just being more relaxed. I want to continue to focus on the approach of relaxing into better and faster swimming instead of being rigid and trying to force myself into it.</p><p>I did cut down the rest time in between significantly. There were a few times that I needed to give myself a bit of extra recovery time, though.</p>
