<p>My legs felt very tired when I started the ride and I was concerned about how the ride was going to go and whether it was a good choice to do the Rooney Road / Golden route. When I reached Jewell / Alameda I looked at the time and saw that I made it there in a pretty typical (maybe faster?) time. The Rooney Road stretch wasn't any more challenging than normal, either. I made it to 19th Street in good time&nbsp;(or maybe a bit faster?)&nbsp;and continued up the trail, aiming for 32nd street. Well, the trail does not connect with 32nd. I ended up winding back into Golden and turned on 10th Avenue. Then I took Washington and ultimately ended up on 44th. I took McIntyre back down to 32nd and followed the normal route back home from there. When I reached Garrison / Florida I still needed about another 8 minutes of ride time, so I continued to Jewell and Lee street. I did almost exactly a 2 hour ride. I can't recall what my average pace has been on this (similar) route previously. So I don't know how the rest of the ride ended up comparing. But, I can say that the day was gloriously beautiful and I really enjoyed the workout.</p><p>This was a nice route and I'll make sure to take it another time.</p>
