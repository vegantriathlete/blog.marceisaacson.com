excerpt: "<p>This was my thirteenth workout in my IM Journey. I was supposed to do
  a Sprint Tri workout. But, I had gotten up at 3:30 in the morning and had worked
  (with a breakfast and lunch break) until around 4:00. By the time I was making my
  way to the gym I knew that it would be too tight to squeeze in the scheduled workout.
  So, instead I swam for about 20 minutes / 1000 yards. It's probably good to have
  the variety. My plan is to do a bike on Wednesday and a run on Thursday. Then I'll
  do my normal workouts on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.</p>"
