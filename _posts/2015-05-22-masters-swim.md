<p>Today's scheduled workout was a 2500 swim workout.</p><p>Green Mountain's pool is closed this week. So, I headed to Carmody to do my own workout. I swam somewhere in the range of 2100 m.</p><p>I had debated whether to head out to the workout this morning. It seems that I've got a pattern of waking up early in the morning on Master's swim days. I don't know exactly when I started lying awake in bed, but I know that Zen wanted to go out around 3:00 AM and I was up before then. I figured that I wasn't going to recover the lost sleep and I wasn't likely to fall asleep anyway so it would be better to at least get something done.</p><p>I ended up enjoying the workout and it is good to have accomplished that task already.</p>
