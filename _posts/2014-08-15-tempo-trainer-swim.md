excerpt: "<p>This was my tenth workout in my IM journey. I'm not sure how long I should
  keep on counting. I don't know if I should keep counting until I miss a workout
  or if I should count until 30 workouts or some other measure. Maybe I should keep
  counting all the way up to IM Boulder. I just think that it may be too boring reading
  the same intro paragraph.</p><p>Anyway, I swam for about 20 minutes. It's pretty
  much the same story: I kept it nice and easy and I'm glad that's what I'm doing
  right now.</p>"
