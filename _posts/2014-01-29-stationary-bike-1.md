excerpt: <p>I rode 30 minutes on the Cybex using the heart rate program.</p><p>Today
  I discovered that I can lock the display to show my RPM. I found it helpful to be
  able to monitor my RPM constantly, instead of waiting for the bike to cycle (no
  pun intended) back to that display. It was also somewhat helpful that I couldn't
  see the elapsed time, although I was definitely looking forward to hitting the "Cool
  down" part of the workout prior to its arrival.</p><p>Early in the workout for a
  short period of time, I maxed out at 18.6 mph. I don't know exactly how many watts
  that was.</p>
