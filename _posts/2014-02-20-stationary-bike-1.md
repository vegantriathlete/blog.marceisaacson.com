<p>I rode for 30 minutes on the Cybex upright bike using the heart rate program at 138bpm for a total of 8.79 miles. I did need to watch that my cadence stayed at 90rpm, as it did dip to as low as 85rpm at times. But, I would not say that it was hard to keep the cadence at 90rpm. I am seeing definite signs that I'm getting stronger on the bike.</p><p>I weighed in at about 136 pounds. Even considering that the full water bottle was just shy of two pounds (and I drank an entire bottle while doing the workout), it seems clear that I've put on weight. I'm going to need to be more careful about how much food / calories I'm consuming. I think that I have started to get better about that recently, though.</p>
