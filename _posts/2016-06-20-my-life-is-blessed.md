excerpt: "<p>Eli wanted to head out to the reservoir this morning to see if the crane
  was out there. We didn't see it at the end near our house, but Eli said he wanted
  to walk all the way around. We did see it at the far end. It was a real joy getting
  to do that early(ish) morning activity with my son. We got to hear so many different
  bird calls and Zen also loved being out for a walk in the field.</p><p>As we got
  back to my house and walked up the boardwalk in the back yard, I looked at Eli's
  jungle gym and my garden (as overgrown with weeds as it is) and felt such a feeling
  of happiness.</p>"
