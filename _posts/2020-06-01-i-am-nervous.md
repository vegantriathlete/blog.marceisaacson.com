excerpt: I don't know if HTZ will close above $1 this week
title: I am nervous about how much of a loss I am facing
---
I was eventually able to sell 18 CALLs of HTZ at a strike of $1.00 for a premium of $0.15 for the June 5, 2020 expiration.
I believe it was partially executed twice before being fully filled.
HTZ closed today at $0.89.
The $1 CALL opened at $0.10.
It had a range for the day of $0.05 - $0.15.
I don't know how much longer this stock is going to keep trading on the NYSE and I'd prefer that it finish above $1 at the end of the week and I have the shares called away from me.
I'd rather not go into next week having to decide if I'm going to sell CALLs at a $1 strike or a $0.50 strike.

I sold one PUT of GPRO at a strike of $4.00 for a premium of $0.05 for the June 5, 2020 expiration.
I had hoped to sell two contracts, but it didn't fetch a premium of $0.05 for much of the day.
The $4 CALL opened at $.05.
It had a range for the day of $0.01 - $0.05.

I sold 13 PUTs of HPE at a strike of $9.50 for a premium of $0.10 for the June 5, 2020 expiration.
HPE closed today at $9.76.
The $9.50 PUT opened at $0.16.
It had a range for the day of $0.08 - $0.17.
I had set my price at $0.30 and then dropped it to $0.20 and $0.15 before bringing it to $0.10.

I sold 3 CALLs of PG at a strike of $117 for a premium of $0.80 for the June 5, 2020 expiration.
PG closed today at $117.25.
It had opened the day at $116 and started out the day trading down.
I had originally set my price at $1.30.
The CALL opened the day at $0.99.
It had a range for the day of $0.79 - $1.52.
So, unfortunately, I caught it on the low end and could have done better if I waited for longer during the day.
The last sold was $1.38.

I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me.
I surrender and am open and ready to receive.
