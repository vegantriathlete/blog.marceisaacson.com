<p>I'm not even going to try to recap the entire past year. I'll just say that it has been an amazing ride.</p><p>It's hard to believe that my son will be one year old in just five days from now. He is not going to be a baby forever. While there were moments with him this past year that felt like they would never end, overall the time has gone by so quickly.</p><p>My web development business did quite well.</p><p>My wife's private practice did well.</p><p>Life is good.</p><p>I had started this blog to make sure that I captured a time when I experienced challenges and emotions that I had never had before. Now, I've reached a point in my life that I feel so blessed every day. And with all the blessings in my life I feel that I've become even more aware of just how wonderful the simplest and most basic things mean to me.</p><p>I love having indoor plumbing and running water. Electricity is great. Forced air gas heat rocks. Appliances like the dishwasher and washing machine make life so much easier.</p><p>This year I not only got my first cell phone, I got a smart phone. It's an Android, naturally. I'm not afraid to admit how much I've enjoyed having it. It's been so wonderful to always have a camera and video camera at the ready.</p><p>Yes, I could be perfectly happy if my life continued just the way it was this past year.</p><p>Happy New Year, everybody!</p><p>I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I am open and ready to receive.</p><p>Bhavatu, sabba, mangalam -- May all beings be happy.</p>
