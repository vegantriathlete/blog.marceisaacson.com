I just finished reading "Start With Why" by Simon Sinek and I'm thinking about how I would answer what my why is. Why am I here? What drives me? I know that I want to make a difference in the world. How do I want to make that difference? I have a general idea of what I would say, but I want to give it more thought.

I'd love to hear your thoughts; they will help me clarify my own. What is your why? Please leave a comment.

I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and am open and ready to receive.

Bhavatu sabba mangalam - May all beings be happy
