<p>I really enjoyed the Masters swim today. This is getting to be quite a lot of fun for me.</p><p>I got up fifteen minutes earlier (4:45) this morning and made it to the workout in plenty of time.

Then I walked for another 5 minutes to round out the workout at 30 minutes.</p><p>Both the swim workout and the run workout felt pleasantly challenging today.</p>
