<p>I'm ready to unleash my power. I'm ready to take advantage of the opportunities that come my way. I'm ready to live up to my potential. I'm ready to make the fiftieth year of my life a breakout year.</p><p>I've had my more-focused times and less-focused times over these last six years or so. On the whole I have to admit that I've been fairly undisciplined and scattered. While it's been fun to have the flexibility and to explore different things, it has also carried a certain cost both financially and emotionally.</p><p>There are things I'd like to accomplish in my life and it's high time that I start to accomplish them. Today is the first day of the rest of my life. And today I'm going to do my best to focus on the activities that will bring me closer to my goals.</p><p>I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and am open and ready to receive.</p><p>Bhavatu sabba mangalam - May all beings be happy</p>
