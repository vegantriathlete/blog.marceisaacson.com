<p>Today's scheduled workout was 1600 yd Swim.</p><p>I got to practice all four strokes today. I got some coaching on how to do butterfly, breast and back. This workout was hard. I'm glad that I didn't have a run to do afterwards.</p><p>Even the warmup was hard. It was 3 X 100; on 25 and 75 breathe every five. The first 25 was not a problem. The other 75's and 25's were quite challenging to make it just breathing every five. It was actually almost scary.</p><p>I had more success practicing the one arm fly. I was able to maintain the stroke, kick and breath rhythm better. When I did it with both arms I really struggled.</p><p>Breast went pretty well. I definitely got a much better sense of how to do it properly and I made some progress.</p><p>For back I switched over to doing a two-beat kick, instead of my usual three-beat / constant flutter.</p><p>All the stroke work wore me out pretty much. I was tired even just doing crawl at the end. I did throw in 100 of kicking with fins on.</p><p>This was a real nice change of pace, though. As hard as the workout was, it was still very fun. I'm glad to be learning the other strokes.</p>
