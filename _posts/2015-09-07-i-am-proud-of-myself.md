<p>This morning I decided that I was going to stay focused today and finally finish my <a href="https://www.udemy.com/draft/548426/" target="_blank" title="Draft URL for my third Udemy course">third</a> <a href="https://www.udemy.com/u/marcisaacson" target="_blank" title="Marc Isaacson Udemy Instructor">Udemy</a> course and submit it for review. I invested 9.6 hours to get it done, but I succeeded! I feel so good right now.</p><p>There are so many times when I get sidetracked and waste a lot of time and / or just outright procrastinate. But, since it was Labor Day I didn't have client work to do. Also, since it's Monday I didn't have a workout to do. Lana wasn't seeing clients tonight and she spent the whole day with Eli, since she needs me to provide coverage on Saturday for her. It seemed the perfect opportunity and I seized it!</p><p>I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and am open and ready to receive.</p><p>Bhavatu sabba mangalam - May all beings be happy</p>
