<p>I finally decided to take the plunge and migrate this site from Drupal 6. Five or so hours later and I'm creating my first post in my Drupal 8 version of this blog. I must say that I am quite pleased with the Migration utilities Drupal 8 provides.</p>

<p>As I was creating this post I did come across one hiccup with the tags taxonomy term entity reference that I quickly resolved.</p>

<p>I do hope that sometime soon I'll rebuild my custom theme.</p>
