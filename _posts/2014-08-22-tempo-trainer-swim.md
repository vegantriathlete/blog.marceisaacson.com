excerpt: <p>This was my sixteenth workout in my IM journey. I swam for about 20 minutes.
  It seemed like I finally started to relax into the rhythm and enjoy the swim close
  to the end. I'm not saying that I was not enjoying the swim at all prior to that.
  But, I definitely had more of an anxiousness about "just getting done with the workout."
  Stating it that way makes it sound more negative than I actually felt, though. So,
  I'm not doing a very good job of conveying the reality.</p>
