excerpt: "<p>I rode for about one hour and fifty four minutes. I took Garrison up
  to 20th and then took 20th across into Golden. I ended up on 32nd and eventually
  19th street. I rode for a while on the trail that runs along highway 93. I'd like
  to do this ride again and take the left at the fork on the path along the highway
  instead of a right to see where that takes me and whether it's a good connection
  to get to 19th street.</p><p>This was a fun ride for me and I'm glad that I have
  a good route to get to 19th street (and the Lookout Mountain ride).</p>"
