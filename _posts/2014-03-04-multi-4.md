excerpt: "<p>I had to make adjustments on just a couple of sets in the masters workout
  today. One set we swam 600m straight. I swam 500m. Another set we swam 600m broken
  up into fast 100m / medium-slow 100m. I swam three fast 100m and two slow 100, skipping
  the last slow 100m.</p><p>I brought my speed down a bit on the 30 minute run, although
  I think I was still in Zone 2. I ran a total of 54 laps in 30.3 minutes, for an
  average pace of just under 9:00 miles.</p>"
