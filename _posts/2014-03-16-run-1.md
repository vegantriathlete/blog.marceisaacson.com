excerpt: "<p>I worked on other things until the temperature warmed up to the 50's
  and the weather was just beautiful for the run. I ran for one hour and fifteen minutes.
  I was probably in Zone 2 for almost the entire workout, but I don't know for certain.
  I wasn't aiming for being in Zone 2, so it's fine if I spent time in Zone 1. I just
  wanted to back down the intensity and enjoy the run. I successfully accomplished
  enjoying the run more. I don't know how much distance I covered, but I could probably
  figure it out if I really wanted to. I'm not going to bother to check, though."

This was a sufficiently challenging, while still enjoyable, workout.</p>
