<p>How the week went overall: It was fair.</p><p>One thing that did not go according to plan: I felt like I could have been more productive.</p><p>One thing that went well: I finished the Appendix section and the rest of the "rough cut" videos for "Mastering Drupal 8 Development."</p><p>Plans for the coming week: Compile the feedback and reach agreement with my collaborators on how to address issues, suggestions, etc; begin work on the next cut (which I hope will be the final cut) on videos.</p>
