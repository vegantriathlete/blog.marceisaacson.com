<p>Today's scheduled workout was a 2500 swim workout and Run 0:45 Z2 with a 7.5 minute pickup at 0:10.</p><p>I think I swam about 2000; I might have forgotten one of the sets that I did. Then I completed the run outside without a HR monitor.</p><p>I really cruised compared to my lane mates on our 2 X 250 pull. The coach said that he thinks I'm about ready to move over to the next lane. I'm pretty happy staying in this lane and I think I push myself hard enough. I don't think I need to try to hang on to the toes of the other swimmers in the next lane over. I'd like to be certain that I'm ready to hang with them.</p>
