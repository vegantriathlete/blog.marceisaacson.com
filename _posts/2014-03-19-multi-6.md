<p>I got in my workout pretty literally at the last minute. I rode my rollers for 30 minutes and then headed outside for a 15 minute run. I got into the shower and headed out to pick up Eli and arrived at the school right around 6:01.</p><p>I rode 10.26 miles at an average pace of 20.4 mph. I think my heart rate stayed below 130 bpm. I kept the cadence right around 90 rpm.</p><p>I ran a route that was extremely close to 15 minutes. I finished up just across the street about 1/2 block from my front door. I didn't have time to swap out the biking heart rate monitor, so I just ran at a pace that felt comfortable; I did, as always, use the metronome to keep a cadence of 90 rpm.</p>
