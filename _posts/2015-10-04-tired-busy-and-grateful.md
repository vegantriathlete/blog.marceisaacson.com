excerpt: <p>I'm continuing to experience insomnia. So, I've been up since very early
  this morning. And, I've been extremely productive today. I spent the major part
  of my day defining and starting to build my <a href="http://www.marceisaacson.com"
  target="_blank">personal branding website</a>. I've decided that I need to take
  a different approach than I've been taking to build up passive income on the Internet.
  Instead of solely teaching people how to do Drupal I am going to branch out into
  producing an entire STEM curriculum. I will also be pursuing affiliate marketing
  opportunities.

<p>I'm continuing to experience insomnia. So, I've been up since very early this morning. And, I've been extremely productive today. I spent the major part of my day defining and starting to build my <a href="http://www.marceisaacson.com" target="_blank">personal branding website</a>. I've decided that I need to take a different approach than I've been taking to build up passive income on the Internet. Instead of solely teaching people how to do Drupal I am going to branch out into producing an entire STEM curriculum. I will also be pursuing affiliate marketing opportunities. To sum everything up, I'm turning into an Internet Marketer! I can't believe it myself.</p><p>I got out for a lovely walk with Zen this afternoon. It was a bit gray and chilly. But, I still enjoyed the cool Fall air. We walked for an hour or so.</p><p>I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and am open and ready to receive.</p><p>Bhavatu sabba mangalam - May all beings be happy</p>
