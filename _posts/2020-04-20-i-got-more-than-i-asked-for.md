excerpt: My contract was executed at a higher premium than I asked for
title: I got more than I asked for
---
My order was ready to go when the market opened today.
It was executed within seconds of when the market opened and I got a $1.40 premium instead of the $1.15 premium I entered as my limit price.
I hadn't even considered that it was possible to get more than I asked for.
I guess there were a lot of buy offers and they fill the higher priced ones first.
My net credit was $555.98, which equals about a 4.6% return.

It's funny because when I looked at the options chain this morning I had debated whether I should cancel my order and place a new one at a higher premium.
Looking at the quote for the day, it seems like it opened at $1.40, went as high as $1.53 and as low as $0.66.
It finished the day at a Bid/Ask of $0.75 / $0.85.

LUV closed at $31.06.
It opened at $30.64, went as high as $31.48 and as low as $29.51.
It will be interesting to see what happens this week when Southwest releases its earnings report and how things finish by Friday.

I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me.
I surrender and am open and ready to receive.
