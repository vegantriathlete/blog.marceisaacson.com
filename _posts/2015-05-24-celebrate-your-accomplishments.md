  Then I took a bit of time to think about that a more. It doesn't make sense for
  me to be frustrated; I'm doing the best I can. I can't push myself any harder. It
  also doesn't make sense for me to be disappointed; I've been extremely disciplined
  about sticking to my workout program. I've completed almost all of my workouts.
  Maybe I missed one swim workout? And I had to take a couple days off one week to
  fully recover from stressing my muscles."

<p>When I was doing my run workout today I was feeling frustrated and disappointed. Then I took a bit of time to think about that a more. It doesn't make sense for me to be frustrated; I'm doing the best I can. I can't push myself any harder. It also doesn't make sense for me to be disappointed; I've been extremely disciplined about sticking to my workout program. I've completed almost all of my workouts. Maybe I missed one swim workout? And I had to take a couple days off one week to fully recover from stressing my muscles. Whatever happens come the day of the IM race, I can and should still celebrate the fact that I traveled the whole journey.</p><p>Assuming I stay healthy and continue to do all my workouts for the next 10 weeks, I've accomplished a lot regardless of what happens on race day.</p><p>I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and am open and ready to receive.</p><p>Bhavatu sabba mangalam - May all beings be happy</p>
