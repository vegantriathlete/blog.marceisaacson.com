<p>I put together my own workout today based on the scheduled workout in the program. The workout was supposed to total 1600 yards, but I had to eliminate 200 yards due to time constraints.

I took 18; 29.6; 19.9 seconds. I'm really glad that I almost hit a 52 second 50 yard pace on the first repeat.</p><p>I had a lot of fun doing this workout.</p><p>I'm much better at the one arm (and one arm fist) with my right arm than with my left arm. I think I can make a lot of improvement in my whole stroke swimming by bringing my left arm up to the ability level of my right arm. The one arm fist drill is a great drill. I think it really helps me to focus on what I am doing and to pay attention to the feedback I'm getting. So, even though it's really tough, I look forward to doing more work with that drill.</p>
