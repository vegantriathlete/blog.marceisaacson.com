excerpt: "<p>I was planning to swim 4000m today. I did 100m warmup because the Masters
  workout was 2400m and I figured I'd do 3 X 500m after the workout. As it turns out,
  the workout included a good bit of speed work that toasted me pretty well. After
  completing just 1 X 500m I decided it would be better for me to call it a day rather
  than just swimming a slow, weak and sloppy 2 X 500.</p>"
