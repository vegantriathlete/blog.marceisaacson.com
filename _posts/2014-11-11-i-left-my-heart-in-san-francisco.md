<p>I traveled out to San Francisco with Lana and Eli so that I could attend BADCamp and visit with our relatives. We departed on Thursday, November 6 and returned on Sunday, November 9. We stayed at the Travelodge on Lombard and Steiner and the camp was at the Palace of Fine Arts Theater. I had an absolute blast being out there and Lynn and Leonard were thrilled to finally meet Eli.</p><p>When we arrived on Thursday we met Lynn and Leonard for lunch at a restaurant on Fillmore street. The clerk behind the motel desk was certain that we couldn't make it up the street pushing Eli in the stroller. But, I was willing to see how well I could do. I'm glad that I did decide to walk to the restaurant. In fact, on Friday morning I got out with Eli to walk the streets just for fun and exercise. I loved walking on the hills and seeing all the houses in the area.</p><p>The location for BADCamp was a lot of fun, too. It was also super convenient to walk to from our motel.</p><p>Pantheon sponsored a party on Saturday night at the Fame Venue in the North Beach (near Chinatown) area. I got a great view of the Bay Bridge as I walked down Broadway.</p><p>Lana got out with Eli every day to see different things in the area and really enjoyed the visit as well.</p><p>One way or another we will end up travelling back out there next year, either for BADCamp or for Leonard's 90th birthday.</p><p>I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and am open and ready to receive.</p><p>Bhavatu sabba mangalam - May all beings be happy</p>
