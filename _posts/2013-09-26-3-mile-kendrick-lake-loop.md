<p>I didn't feel ready to run again yesterday. I felt fine today, although not charged up to do the workout. The workout went fine, although I didn't feel light and fast like I did two days ago. I think it makes sense that I should still aim for three runs each week and see how I feel with increasing the distance.</p><p>I wore the running tights and the long sleeve Bucktown 5K shirt, which was comfortable enough. I probably could have worn a t-shirt and still been comfortable enough as well, although mabye just a bit on the chilly side. When I checked a thermometer on a neighbor's porch it read around 48 degrees. I don't know if there is any reflected warmth from the house. So, as far as the temperature goes, it was close enough to 50 degrees that I should have been comfortable in shorts and a t-shirt. I think that I would have been too cold if I had shorts on.</p><p>I'm thinking that I won't run again this week. I'd like to get at least one, and ideally two, bike rides in over the next three days.</p>
