But, I'm glad that I gathered had the data available for the warmup. It's probably good that I've got the data for the cool down as well. Over time I suppose that it may be worthwhile to be able to compare my times on the drill sets, too.</p><p>I feel like I did a great job keeping the rest time in between repeats and sets very low.</p>
