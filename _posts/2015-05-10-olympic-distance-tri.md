<p>Today's scheduled workout was an Olympic Distance Tri.</p><p>I rode my bike to the pool, swam 1500m, rode my bike back home and dropped off my backpack and then finished up the rest of the distance on the bike. I ended up riding just over 25 miles by the time I pulled up to my door. Then I headed out on the run.</p><p>I don't know how long it took me to do each part. I just maintained a comfortable pace.</p><p>I was a little tired on the run and probably maintained a pretty slow pace.</p><p>It's a little scary to think that I'm going to need to do almost four times the distance I covered today. I still don't feel ready to do that. Time will tell.</p>
