excerpt: "<p>I swam something like 50 X 25 yds. I had to start in the short lanes.
  I used 1.17 (or 1.16?) seconds per stroke. On my last repetition I took something
  like 20 or 21 strokes. I think that I've got a smoother more rhythmic stroke now
  and I'm on the right track to eliminate the dead spot at the front of my stroke
  and to improve my speed. I don't know if I will start up with the Masters swim next
  week or if I will wait one more week.</p>"

I think that I will resist the urge to time myself, though. Instead, I think that I will focus on continuing to bring down my seconds per stroke while maintaining my strokes per length and have faith that the math works itself out.</p>
