excerpt: The stock market was definitely not good to me today
title: Well, that certainly didn't go my way
---
Bad News: All of my stocks were down the entire day.
None of my CALLs were filled.

Good News: My win streak surely had to end at some point and it's probably better that I get to learn that sooner rather than later.
Now I get to be patient and show that I'm not so greedy or anxious.
I also get to see that I need to learn more than just selling PUTs and CALLs.

I'm definitely disappointed that I may have to sit this week out.
I really enjoy trading options.
However, I'm not ready to buy CALLs or PUTs.
I don't want to have to predict which direction the stock is heading;
how much it's going to move;
and be right that it will happen before expiration on Friday.

I'm still extremely new to all of this.
It's going to take time for me to learn and grow.
I'm also going to have to gain more experience before a brokerage firm will allow me to trade spreads.

So, maybe I can treat this week as a cooling off period.
Maybe I can give my brain a break.
Maybe I can embrace this as something positive.

I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me.
I surrender and am open and ready to receive.

Bhavatu sabba mangalam - May all beings be happy
