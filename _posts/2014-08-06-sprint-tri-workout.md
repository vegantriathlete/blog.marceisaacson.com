excerpt: "<p>Today was my second workout in my 2015 IM Journey: 5 minutes swim, 26.5
  minutes bike, 17.5 minutes run. I think I'm doing a good job of keeping an easy
  / moderate intensity on the swim and the run. But, I think I still need to back
  off the intensity a bit on the bike. Part of the issue is probably due to the fact
  that I'm riding a course on the Expresso bike and I'm getting too competitive. The
  truth is, that when I ride one of the Basic courses I am so much faster than the
  Pacer. It might be worthwhile for me to back things down to the level of the Pacer.</p>"
