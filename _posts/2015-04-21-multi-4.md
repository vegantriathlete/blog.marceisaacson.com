This was by far the fastest I have run this route, even before I started the 10 minute pickup. I not only completed the whole route, I had to add a bit on the end.</p><p>I would say that I swam relatively fast as well.</p><p>I'm definitely feeling a bit tired now. This was a good workout this morning!</p>
