excerpt: "<p>I rode for 1:47:27 for a total of 36.95 miles at an average pace of 20.5
  mph. I kept my heart rate around 125 - 130 bpm. I broke it up into three 30 minutes
  and one 15 minute repeat.</p><p>The third 30 minute repeat got really uncomfortable.
  I took a bit of a longer break after that one before I did the final 15 minute repeat.
  When in comes time to do two hours I think I will take a longer break after the
  second 30 minute repeat. I don't know if I can manage more than three hours. I'm
  begin limited by the numbness in my hands and crotch as much as or more than feeling
  tired in my legs.</p>"
