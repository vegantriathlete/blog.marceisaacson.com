I did do my workout this morning as well.</p><p>So, I've basically just got to take the hit for about three - four hours in which I could have been more productive. I accept responsibility for that lapse. And, I'll make sure to get busy straight away to make a bit more progress on the Modal API section of my class.</p><p>I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me.
