excerpt: "<p>The way things worked out today my only option was to ride my rollers.
  I did two 30 minute repeats and three 20 minute repeats.</p><p>The most challenging
  thing about the workout was that my hands would get completely numb. My crotch experienced
  a little numbness, too. I can't see how I could piece together more than two hours
  this way. It would be hard for me to have to do very many of these workouts. If
  I am stuck inside a lot I will have to come up with other options. It would probably
  make sense for me to get some type of resistance trainer.</p>"
