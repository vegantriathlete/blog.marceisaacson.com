excerpt: "<p>I swam for 1/2 hour in the hotel pool at 1.30 seconds per stroke and
  ran on the treadmill for 1/2 hour. The pool was a bit short and it was tricky doing
  flip turns. I set the treadmill at a 2% incline. I'm glad that I was able to do
  this workout. I'm proud that I'm sticking to the program even as I'm at DrupalCon.</p>"
