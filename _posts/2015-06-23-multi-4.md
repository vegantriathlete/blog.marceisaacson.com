excerpt: "<p>I moved up to the next lane today. I had to skip just 200 meters of the
  workout. There was a set of 5 X 100 and I would probably have been about 50m behind
  if I swam the last repeat. The other 100 was when we were doing a 4 X 100 IM order,
  with a kick 25 / swim 25 pattern. Again I would have been too far behind if I finished
  up the last 100.</p><p>I did a shortened run, with just one loop around Kendrick
  to see what pace I was maintaining. I think I did about an 11:15. I took Zen out
  for a walk later in the day.</p>"
