excerpt: I would have had to charge $0.24 if I didn't find somebody to give me a quarter

title: Brother can you spare a dime?

Last weekend I did some shopping at a home improvement store. I had a store credit that came $0.24 short of paying for the items I purchased. Unfortunately, I don't generally carry any cash (or coins). I was in the self-checkout line and the attendant didn't have any change and couldn't do anything to complete the transaction for me. I went out to my car and did not have any change in the console. So, I decided to beg strangers for money. The first person I asked did not have any change. The second person I asked was able to give me a quarter. I view this as a great experience for a number of reasons.

* I was willing to ask for and receive help from somebody else
* I gave somebody else the opportunity to be helpful
* I got a chance to gain perspective on my life around the fact that I am doing extremely well financially right now, and still I needed "financial assistance" from somebody else

Of course, I could have come up with a different strategy. For instance, I could have gone back into the store and picked up another item to bring my outstanding balance due to a larger amount and then just paid with charge. But, I'm glad that I did not do that. I am so used to being overly independent. I'm proud of myself for being willing to be interdependent. I'm also proud that I was able to "beg" without feeling any sense of shame. In fact, I found it to be quite amusing. I feel fortunate that I was granted this opportunity.

I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and am open and ready to receive.
