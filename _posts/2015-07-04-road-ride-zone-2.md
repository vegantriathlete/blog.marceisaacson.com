<p>I drove up to Boulder and parked in a shopping center lot at Folsom and Arapahoe. I headed up Folsom and rode one loop of the first section of the IM course and the second section of the course. The second section was much harder than I thought it was going to be based on looking at the elevation profile.</p><p>I rode approximately 4:54 and covered just over 70 miles averaging 14.4 mph. I'm happy that I averaged over 14!</p><p>I did a much better job hydrating myself and I think that I can drink still more. Fortunately, as I was making my way to the second section I came across a gas station and filled up my water bottles. I would have been in big trouble if I hadn't done that. Two Clif bars covered me pretty well.</p><p>Next week I plan to ride two loops of the first section of the course, aiming for a six hour ride. I'll bring three Clif bars with me. I noticed that there was a place on 75th street where a bunch of cyclists had pulled off. I'll make sure to fill my water bottles there.</p>
