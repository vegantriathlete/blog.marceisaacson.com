excerpt: "<p>I volunteered for National Public Land Day today in the morning. Then
  I worked on some of my gardening / landscaping projects while I waited for a friend
  to come over to help me start to put together Eli's new play set. We worked on the
  play set for about three hours until it started to get dark.</p><p>I've still got
  a good ways to go to finish putting together the set, so it looks like I'll be getting
  to work on that tomorrow morning and spending as much of the day as I can on it.
  Our goal is to have it ready for the break-the-fast gathering at our house next
