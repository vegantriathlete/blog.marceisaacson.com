excerpt: "<p>This was my sixth workout in my IM journey. I ran for about 70 minutes
  as easy as I could make it. I can say that I am not ready to increase my volume
  by 10% next week. I am going to keep the same six workouts next week as I did this
  week. I will also make sure to really back down my effort on the bike leg. I was
  feeling sore and tired before I started the workout today. I was also feeling like
  I had a little bit of a cold starting this morning.</p>"
