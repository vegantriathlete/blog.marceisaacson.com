Since this is my first workout at 1 hour, I needed to extend the route a bit. I ran down to Dartmouth and over to Estes back up to Jewell and then into Kendrick Lake. I did not quite two loops around the lake and then headed back to Carmody. I came up just short.</p><p>I felt fine on the run overall. The pickup went very well as far as I'm concerned.</p>
