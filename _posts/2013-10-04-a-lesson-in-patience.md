<p>Last night my nose was congested and my throat was somewhat sore. I decided that I would skip my workout this morning. I don't know if I had taken the day off yesterday if I would have been able to do the workout today. But, I can't go back in time.</p><p>When I woke up this morning, I felt basically like I did yesterday morning and I was a little disappointed that I had decided I was going to skip this workout. Just as I probably should have skipped the workout yesterday, it's probably better that I am skipping the workout today.</p><p>I think that maybe the Universe is giving me a chance to show that I am willing to be smart about how I approach this journey I have undertaken. It's so much better that I miss these workouts than miss workouts once I am officially doing the 30 weeks of the program.</p><p>It's funny how already I am struggling with having to skip a workout. I got hooked again so fast after having been off for so long. I'll need to continue to train smartly so that I will always want to do my workouts, as opposed to pushing myself to a point that I'm getting burnt out and looking for reasons to skip my workouts.</p><p>I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and am open and ready to receive.</p><p>Bhavatu, sabba, mangalam -- May all beings be happy.</p>
