  meant to be something of a tempo training workout. I swam 6 X 500. It took me about
  an hour and each repeat was right around 10 minutes.</p><p>This is the longest I
  have ever swum in one session. I'm moderately tired, but feeling great overall.
  I'm glad that I did this set today. I think it's worth doing again sometime before
  the race in August.</p>"
