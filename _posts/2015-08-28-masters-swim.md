<p>I didn't get to bed early enough last night and then I didn't get a good night's sleep. But, I still held my motivation fast and made it to the workout. As usual, I was totally glad that I did. I didn't have to deal with all the impossible breath work like last week's workout. This workout was somewhat easier on that account, but I definitely still worked hard.</p><p>I didn't include the run because I had to get back to the house early enough to head out the door with guests to a day of site-seeing in Colorado Springs and because I would have wanted to avoid being wiped out like I was last week having included the run.</p><p>I had plenty of energy to do all the driving and site-seeing today.</p>
