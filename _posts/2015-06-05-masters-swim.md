excerpt: "<p>I think I swam 2450 today. One of the sets was 4X100 - 5 seconds rest;
  3X100 - 10 seconds rest ; 2X100 - 15 seconds rest; 100, swimming at a faster pace
  / 100 on each group of 100. I did the 4/3/2 based on perceived effort, starting
  with a relaxed feel for the 4. On the 100 I timed myself to see what I could do
  with an essentially 100% effort and came in at about 1:50.</p><p>I feel good!</p>"
