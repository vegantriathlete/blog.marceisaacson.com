  heading to Morrison Road and back up to Dinosaur Ridge. I was surprised that it
  didn't seem very hard at all riding over the ridge. I had remembered it as so hard.

  continued on 38th east for a while before making my way back.</p><p>I really felt
  good and strong at the end of the workout, although my average speed wouldn't indicate
  that I was strong at all. I do think that this was a reasonably hilly workout, though.</p>"
