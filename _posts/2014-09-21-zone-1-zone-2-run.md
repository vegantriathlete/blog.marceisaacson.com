excerpt: "<p>I ran with Lana for 30 minutes and then continued running by myself for
  about 45 minutes. I felt comfortable through the whole workout and would have been
  willing to run for longer. Since I had already ridden about two hours yesterday,
  I feel comfortable moving up my workout time. I won't do the full Week 10 program,
  though. I will leave the Tuesday run at 30 minutes, but will increase the Sunday
  run to 90 minutes. I will plan to once again do the Saturday ride at two hours.
  However, next Saturday is going to be somewhat busy for me. So, I'll have to see
  if I end up having enough time.</p>"
