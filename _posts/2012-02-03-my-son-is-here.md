<p>On January 2, 2012 at 9AM Mountain Lana and I went to St. Joseph's hospital to see if our doctor could perform an external version. To get straight to the point, what ended up happening was that we delivered our son via Cesarean section at 12:44:21PM Mountain time that day.</p><p>I don't feel too bad about not having posted here on account of the fact that I have been busy (as though that's a great surprise with a new child and returning to my web development work) and I've been creating posts and adding pictures and videos to my son's website.</p><p>I am enjoying my new role as father and the new role I am playing as a husband. On the whole I am finding it easier than I thought it would be, but at times I do find it challenging to deal with the amount of attention my son needs and how much he can cry when not getting that attention. I feel so fortunate that I am able to work at home and to have flexibility in my schedule.</p><p>While this post may seem completely void of emotion and enthusiasm, that's just a result of my being tired (although not totally exhausted) at the moment. I'm truly in love with my son and absolutely thrilled to see him thriving the way he is.</p><p>I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and am open and ready to receive.</p><p>Bhavatu, sabba, mangalam -- May all beings be happy.</p>
