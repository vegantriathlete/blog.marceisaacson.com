<p>I was having problems punching the lap timer button. So, my times for the practice are not very accurate. The good news is that it seems like I did get the gasket to seal properly on the watch. I'm not seeing any signs of moisture in the display.</p><p>Since the data was not accurate enough, I am not going to do any quantitative analysis.</p><p>This practice was 1 X 50 yards @ 1.40; 1.39; . . . ; 1.21 seconds per stroke for a total of 1000 yards.</p><p>I was very happy with this practice. I felt in control all the way down to 1.21 seconds per stroke. My stroke count held pretty consistent at around 17 - 19 strokes out and 18 - 20 strokes back.</p><p>I can't tell accurately if I got faster all the way down to 1.21 or if I levelled out at some point. I don't think I ever swam as fast as 53 seconds per 50, but I would confidently say that I was staying around 54 - 55 seconds. I can also say with reasonable confidence that I did get faster from 1.4 down to about 1.32. Beyond that point I can't draw any conclusions.</p><p>I hope that the data collection is more accurate tomorrow. While I won't be able to compare the times from tomorrow directly with the times from today, I hope that I will be able to get a clearer picture of whether I continue to improve my speed from 1.40 down to 1.21.</p><p>1.21 felt much better for me today than it did on Thursday or Monday. But, I'm guessing that it's probably still too fast.</p><p>Overall the practice felt good. I never felt like I was struggling.</p>
