<p>Ooops, well I created the last two posts as Blog Entries instead of Training Diaries. Oh, well.</p><p>I did another Mini Sprint workout today: 5 minute swim, 20 minute bike, 15 minute run. I rode a different bike today and it definitely registered my heart rate higher than the Expresso bike. I just kept things really easy for all three segments. It's good just to be getting back into the exercise routine and I was pretty tired heading to the workout. I haven't been sleeping through the night for the past two nights. So, it's probably lack of sleep as opposed to being tired from the two previous workouts.</p>
