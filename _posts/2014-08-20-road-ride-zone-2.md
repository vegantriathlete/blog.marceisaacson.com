<p>This was my fourteenth workout in my IM journey. I decided to do something a little different. I rode my bike to Eli's school to pick him up. On the way home I added a little side excursion to increase my total riding time. Riding to the school took about 25 minutes. Riding back was much faster because it's downhill all the way.</p><p>This was a really fun way to get an easy workout and it was nice to buy myself a little more time to get some work done, be more environmentally friendly&nbsp;and&nbsp;spend some time with Eli while I got exercise. It really was a win-win-win proposition. I may have to take advantage of it more in the future as the opportunity allows.</p>
