This blog entry is one way I am addressing this inequity.</p><p>Thanks, Universe, for allowing me to witness that amazing little creature.</p><p>I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and am open and ready to receive.</p><p>Bhavatu sabba mangalam - May all beings be happy</p>
