excerpt: "<p>This was my eleventh workout in my IM Journey. I was not wearing a HR
  monitor, so I don't really know what Zone I was riding in. But, it was my intention
  to keep it in Zone 1. I intended to ride for one hour and 46 minutes. I ended up
  riding about two hours and six minutes. Since I had ridden West to find the trail
  that runs along C470 I had to deal with a fair amount of hilliness. I spent a large
  amount of the workout riding in the lowest gear on my bike.</p>"

<p>This was my eleventh workout in my IM Journey. I was not wearing a HR monitor, so I don't really know what Zone I was riding in. But, it was my intention to keep it in Zone 1. I intended to ride for one hour and 46 minutes. I ended up riding about two hours and six minutes. Since I had ridden West to find the trail that runs along C470 I had to deal with a fair amount of hilliness. I spent a large amount of the workout riding in the lowest gear on my bike.</p><p>I did eventually connect with the C470 trail and I took it South(east) until Kipling, where I then headed back home. I'd like to find a better way to connect with the trail than I took. It is definitely a long trail that can provide a really long ride. I think it continues South(east) for a good distance, even connecting with other trails.</p>
