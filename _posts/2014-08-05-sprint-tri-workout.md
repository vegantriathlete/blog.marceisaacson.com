<p>Last night I put together a spreadsheet to layout my current plan for the rest of 2014. The plan calls for a 10% increase in each of the workouts each week. This week the Sprint Workouts are 5 minutes swim, 26.5 minutes bike and 17.5 minutes run.</p><p>I rode the Expresso bike and chose the Evening Bliss ride. It's definitely much more enjoyable to do the workout to one of the rides. I think that I rode with too high an intensity, though. Tomorrow I will back things down considerably. I really want to make sure to adjust gradually so that I don't put myself back in a situation in which I'm having to miss workouts.</p>
