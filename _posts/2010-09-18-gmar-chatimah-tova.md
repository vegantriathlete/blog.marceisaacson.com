<p>It is almost the end of Yom Kippur. My fast has been reasonably easy.</p>
<p>This morning I attended services and continued my practice from last year: I created my own sacred space by covering myself with my tallit and engaged in my own form of prayer. One different twist this year was that a friend of mine got married today. So, I left my services this morning early and headed out to his ceremony. He was married in a traditional Catholic ceremony.</p>
<p>The church where he was married is a small one that was established in 1919. It was a modest and unpretentious ceremony. The bride's sister was the matron of honor. The groom had a best man. There was a young boy who was the ring bearer and a couple of young girls who tossed rose petals on the floor. They did not do any additional decorating of the church.</p>
<p>For me, this was a touching experience. It was so nice to see that the whole point of this ceremony was to formalize the union between my friend and his bride-to-be. There was no attempt to impress anybody else. It was good for me to see this couple starting their new life together in such a simple fashion. I thought that my wife and I had a simple wedding. Compared to this one ours was quite lavish. I didn't attend my friend's reception. But, I'm sure it was equally low-key.</p>
<p>The ceremony really made me think just how comfortable my life has been. I have been so fortunate to have experienced many luxuries that I'm sure most of the world has not experienced. Maybe this past year hasn't been so challenging after all. There is still so much for me to be thankful for in my life. I hope it's not too late to ask forgiveness of the Universe if I have been ungrateful.</p>
<p>I think today made a great start to the new year ahead. May we all be sealed for a good life.</p>
<p>I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and I am open and ready to receive. Time to break the fast!</p>
