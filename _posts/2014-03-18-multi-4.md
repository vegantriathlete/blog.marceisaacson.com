<p>I kept up the best I could during the swim workout. I had to get out of the pool again before the workout was over since I realized that I was done.</p><p>I ran for 45 minutes on the indoor track and didn't bother to count my laps.</p><p>As I'm entering my 10th week of this training program I think that I am starting to settle more into a mode of "take it as it comes" instead of focusing so much on engineering an outcome. I can see that I still have a very long road ahead of me and I need to be able to go the distance and enjoy the journey. So, I am very happy with the way I approached things today and with the way I have been approaching things recently.</p>
