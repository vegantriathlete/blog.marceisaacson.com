excerpt: "<p>I was up very early this morning. I worked for a couple of hours before
  the swim workout. I did have an inkling to just keep working and do a different
  workout later in the day. But, I decided it would be better to get to the workout.
  As it turns out, the coach wasn't there today and I put together my own workout.
  I'm still glad that I completed the workout early in the day.</p>"
