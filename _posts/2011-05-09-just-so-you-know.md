excerpt: <p>I was fooling around configuring comment notification on the site and
  had a look at the <a href="/blog/2011/04/25/goodbye-my-sweet-princess">previous
  blog entry</a>. It's been two weeks since I had to say goodbye to one of my beloved
  pets and I've been doing great. Still, it's funny how I have to choke back the tears
  reading the blog post and thinking about it. In fact, the tears are flowing now.
  I can't say exactly why, since I have already had many occasions to let people know
  that Tofu is no longer around and none of them triggered tears.</p>

<p>I was fooling around configuring comment notification on the site and had a look at the <a href="/blog/2011/04/25/goodbye-my-sweet-princess">previous blog entry</a>. It's been two weeks since I had to say goodbye to one of my beloved pets and I've been doing great. Still, it's funny how I have to choke back the tears reading the blog post and thinking about it. In fact, the tears are flowing now. I can't say exactly why, since I have already had many occasions to let people know that Tofu is no longer around and none of them triggered tears.</p>
<p>Anyway, Zen has been the best little boy these past two weeks. He's sleeping like a little angel right now. I've been practicing my meditation for one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening every day. It's been surprisingly easy to add that to my schedule, although still not so easy to sit for one hour. I also take Zen for a walk around the reservoir after my morning meditation; I actually started the morning walk prior to the retreat and would take both dogs.</p>
<p>I know that I wrote that I would create a post (or more) about the retreat and I still plan to do so. Life just keeps happening, though. It's not that I couldn't have made any time to sit down and write a bit; I just haven't made it a priority. Fortunately, I have plenty of web development work to keep me busy; the weather has been nice and I've gotten Zen out for lots of walks in the afternoon; and I've done some things with Lana on the weekend (like yesterday when we went to the Wild Basin area of Rocky Mountain National Park).</p>
<p>I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and am open a ready to receive.</p>
