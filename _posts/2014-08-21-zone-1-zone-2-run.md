excerpt: "<p>This was my fifteenth workout in my IM journey. I ran for about 45 minutes.
  Even though my right hamstring was feeling tight after I walked Zen, I decided that
  I would still get out for the workout and see if I could relax and release. The
  hamstring continued to be a little touchy through the workout, but I enjoyed the
  workout nonetheless. I think that I have finally started to find the right groove
  for myself. I am beginning to enjoy the workouts instead of just completing them.</p>"
