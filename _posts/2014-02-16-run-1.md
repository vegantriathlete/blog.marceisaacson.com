excerpt: "<p>I ran for 30 minutes around Kendrick Lake. I averaged around a 9:00 mile.
  I don't know why the pace is so much slower than when I'm on the track at tbe fitness
  center. There are many possible reasons, though: it's warmer inside, the length
  of the track is not accurate, I didn't count my number of laps accurately on the
  track, it's not exactly one mile around Kendrick Lake.</p><p>Regardless, I'm at
  wherever I'm at. Also, this pace is definitely quite a bit faster than where I was
  at even just last weekend.</p>"

I don't think it helped my pace at all that I had to keep adjusting the heart rate monitor like I was tugging on a bra strap for the whole workout; the strap has loosened more and the monitor kept slipping down my chest.</p>
