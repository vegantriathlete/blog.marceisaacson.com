<p>I rode for about 3 hours. I made it back just before it started to rain, which eventually turned into a downpour and hailstorm.</p><p>I'm still riding without the heart rate monitor, as my intention is to keep the workouts easy. However, living in the foot hills means that I'm going to get some hill work no matter what I do.</p><p>I would say that the workout was enjoyable enough, but wasn't exactly easy.</p><p>The bike computer reported an average pace of 13.7 mph. I definitely hope that Boulder is relatively flat or it's going to take me ridiculously long to ride the 56 miles and I'll be exhausted when I'm done. The description for the bike course says</p><p><em>The one-loop, 56-mile bike course will be a fast and flowing course in North Boulder and Larimer Counties. It will also pass through the western neighborhoods of Longmont. With 1,200 feet of gain it promises to test your legs on the north end of the course. Some of the nationâ€™s fastest average times have come out of Boulder due to the speed at which our athletes can maintain on this course.</em></p><p>The minimum elevation is 5215 feet and the max is 5715 feet.</p><p>The elevation chart shows that it's basically all uphill for the first 11.2 miles, gaining the full 500 feet. Then it's pretty much down hill through mile 40 or so. It finishes with a gradual climb to the end.</p><p>I wonder how much gain I've experienced on my rides out here.</p>
