  There were so many things that I wasn't doing right and which I had misinterpreted.
  I've got so much room for improvement and am extremely excited about how making
  those improvements will translate into better and faster swimming.</p><p>I just
  scheduled my next lesson for 8am Sunday, December 8.</p><p>I think that this week
