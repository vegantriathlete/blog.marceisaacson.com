excerpt: "<p>I ran with Lana for about 35 minutes and then I finished the rest of
  the 90 minute run. It was around 50 degrees when we started running and that was
  very comfortable. It warmed up considerably during the course of the run, and while
  somewhat warm by the end it was still comfortable enough and a beautiful day.</p><p>It
  was hard for me to plan what route to run after leaving Lana, so I ended up hitting
  the finish time pretty much just as I was reaching the top of the Old Kipling road
  climb. I walked home the rest of the way. But, it was kind of fun wrapping up the
  workout with the cilmb.</p>"
