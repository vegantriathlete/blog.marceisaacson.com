<p>My phone interview went well enough that I am going in for a second round interview tomorrow afternoon. I would be thrilled to pick up full-time employment. This company has a tremendous backlog of projects, too. So, there would be job security :-) Working on Drupal full-time will accelerate my learning phenomenally. Come on, Universe! Let's start to rock and roll.</p>
<p>In other news, I still have just a bit more to complete that one never-ending job, but I'm oh-so-close now. I applied the second coat of mud on the drywall job and things look great there. I took another run out to the landscaping job to check on some measurements.</p>
<p>Things are moving along.</p>
<p>Thanks for checking in.</p>
