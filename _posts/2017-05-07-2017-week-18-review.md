<p>I flew to San Antonio for a project on Sunday afternoon and I worked massive hours on the project all week long. I didn't put one minute into the course. I would have liked to have gotten more done on the project as well.</p><p>I'm flying back out to San Antonio tonight. Fortunately, I was able to package up an alpha release of my work and send it to the project lead. Let's see how much more I can bang out this week while I'm in Texas. Perhaps I'll aim for doing some screen capture for the course in the evenings in my hotel room.</p>
