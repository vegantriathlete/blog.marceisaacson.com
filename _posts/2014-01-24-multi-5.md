<p>I ran for 15 minutes in Zone 2 followed by a swim workout of 950 yards.</p><p>I really liked doing the pyramid swim workout. I maintained my stroke count right around 19 or 20 strokes per length. Early on in the workout and in each repetition I could make it in 18 strokes.</p><p>I charted the graph to show the calculated seconds / 50 yards so that it would be easier to see how I did throughout the workout. It's interesting that it settled in at about 60 seconds per 50 yards regardless of the length of the repeat or the seconds per stroke. I did the 100 warmup and cooldown at 1.36 seconds per stroke and all the remaining repeats at 1.34 seconds per stroke.</p><p><img src="/sites/blog.marceisaacson.com/files/uploads/tempo-trainer-20140124.png" alt="Line chart of swim data" width="542" height="302" /></p><p>It's telling that even at the shortest repeat, right at the beginning, which was my fastest time I was still not able to hit my 53 seconds per 50. So, I've obviously got my work cut out for me there.</p><p>I think that the first 100 repeat is overstated. I didn't punch out successfully the first try. I wouldn't be at all surprised if the time were really 58 point something or 59 seconds, which would put it right on the line from the first repeat to the fifth repeat.</p><p>This workout took only about 24 minutes, so I could have kept doing more repeats for another six minutes. Maybe next week I will extend the workout if I see that I am finishing before 30 minutes.</p><p>I can say that I definitely did feel that I wasn't doing a good job catching the water. I could tell that I was letting a lot of water slip. I'll just keep paying attention to that feeling and let my body figure out what needs to change. If it doesn't work itself out in a reasonable amount of time, I'll go in for another swim lesson with Danny to have him give me some pointers.</p>
