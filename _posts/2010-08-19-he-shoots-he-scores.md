<p>So I would say that I hit one out of the park today on my first real (although partial) day on the job.

<p>I hope my employers are duly impressed. I'm sure pleased with what I was able to do and I think the Drupal community would approve, too; my solution wasn't *too* hackish and I made decent use of Drupal's native structure and functionality. If the decision is to not bother with creating a full-blown module, then I will probably just post a comment in a forum topic that is related to this same issue to describe my solution to the problem.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for further updates.</p>
<p>Yay, me!</p>
