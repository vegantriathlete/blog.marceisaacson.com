<p>I woke Eli up at 7:45 this morning and made it out the door with him by around 8:20am. I got to the fitness center just after 8:45am. As soon as I started to take Eli out of his stroller he started crying. So, I spent some time with him in the child care room before I started the workout.</p><p>Eli basically cried the entire time I was working out and the time was getting tight (to be able to get back home and head to the library), so I completed only the exercises with the equipment. I did not do the core training. My hope is that I will complete that while he is napping. However, I need to let my food go down first. I hadn't eaten much all morning and didn't want to do the core training before I had anything, since I was so hungry by the time we got back from the library (and picking Lana up from the body shop).</p><p>Next week I think I need to plan to drive instead of walk. I don't see how I can squeeze enough time out of the morning to be able to get to library in time for story time. We caught maybe five or ten minutes today.</p><p>I kept all the weights the same today. I think that on Wednesday I will increase the Lat Pulldown and the Chest Press weights.</p>
