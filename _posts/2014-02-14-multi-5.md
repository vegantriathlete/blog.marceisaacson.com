<p>I ran for 30 minutes on the indoor track at the fitness center. I completed 59 laps (assuming that I didn't mess up counting, which is not guaranteed) in just over 30 minutes. That's around an 8:12 min / mile pace.</p><p>Then I swam 1600 yards (assuming I counted correctly, which is not guaranteed). It took me about 31 minutes and 39 seconds. That calculates to around 118 - 119 seconds per 100. I settled in at about 21 strokes per length. I feel reasonably confident that I could have maintained that pace and stroke length for some additional distance, at least for a total of 1.2 miles. However, I don't feel very confident that I would maintain it for 2.4 miles, yet.</p><p>I'm really glad that I did the extended swim. As it turns out, the program called for a 1600 swim at today's workout.</p>
