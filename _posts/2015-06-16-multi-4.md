  was approximately a 13 minute pace. But, I couldn't even sustain that for the second
  loop. In order to maintain the cadence I have to shrink my steps to a point that
  I ended up taking more than 15 minutes on the next loop.</p><p>Later in the afternoon
  I took Zen out for a walk and did another test around the lake. I just walked as
  fast as I could at whatever cadence resulted. I maintained about a 15 minute pace.</p>"
