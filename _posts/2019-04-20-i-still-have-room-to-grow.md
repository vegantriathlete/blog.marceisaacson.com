title: I still have room to grow

TL;DR I got feedback from a colleague that I have a tendency to talk and talk and talk.

I admit that I can be a chatterbox and that I have been told more than once in my life that a person can ask me what time it is and I will tell him how to build a clock. However, I thought that I was being more careful about listening more and talking less in my current job. It seems that is not always the case. The colleague who gave me the feedback (in the most sensitive and caring way, I will say) has not even had that much opportunity to interact with me. And yet, he still was able to observe an issue I have dealt with throughout my life. I am grateful that he cares enough about me to give me this important feedback.

Of course, nobody is perfect; I don't expect myself to be perfect. My concern is that if I can't address this weakness it can have a negative affect on my career trajectory and what I hope to accomplish at the company. To be honest, I'm afraid of whether I am going to be able to change this habit. I expressed my fear to Lana and she said that she's certain I can learn how to maintain a better balance of listening and talking.

Let's see . . .

I give thanks to the Universe for the abundance it provides me. I surrender and am open and ready to receive.
