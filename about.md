You may wonder about the meaning behind the name of my blog. It's a reference to the audacious notion that there are people out there who want to read about the things that I want to write about. Why do I hold the belief that my life is interesting enough, the things I write about are important enough, and my ability to write is entertaining enough? Why? Because I'm YAPWISE.

Thanks for visiting my site. I hope you enjoy. Please do leave comments when one of my posts provokes a reaction in you.
